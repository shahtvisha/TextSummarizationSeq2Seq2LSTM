              "{'article': \"anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status , motor deficits , apathy , and depression [ 13 ] . \\n although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , \\n our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . \\n overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . \\n for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . \\n likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . \\n however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . \\n one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . \\n furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . \\n two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . \\n the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . \\n furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , \\n it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . \\n it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . \\n given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . \\n furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . \\n seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . \\n the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . \\n inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . \\n patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . \\n ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . \\n patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . \\n thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . \\n this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . \\n self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . \\n a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . \\n this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . \\n the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way \\n this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . \\n processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . \\n attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . \\n working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . \\n language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . \\n the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) \\n demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . \\n chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . \\n all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . \\n spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . \\n as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . \\n groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . \\n additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . \\n there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . \\n the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . \\n neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . \\n logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . \\n there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . \\n participants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety . \\n lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda. \\n this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety . \\n the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd . \\n more specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together , \\n these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] . \\n although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time \\n , chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention . \\n recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety , \\n for example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety . \\n it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance . \\n anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses . \\n this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study . \\n noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd . \\n selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] . \\n overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology . \\n future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related , \\n future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients . \\n research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms . \\n future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients . \\n previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits . \\n for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology . \\n thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial . \\n it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety . \\n results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety . \\n although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically . \\n recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings . \\n based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain . \\n future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd . \\n another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study . \\n future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd . \\n one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression . \\n although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads . \\n controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work . \\n considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd . \\n anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options . \\n moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] . \\n future research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog .\",\n",

world clinical practice . in contrast with the western data in which vte is predominantly a disease of older age , 44% patients in our study were between 40 and 59 years of age while 34% were below 40 years , particularly those with pe . in a study from north india , \\n men constituted 70% of our registry , more than those reported from vellore registry ( 48% ) , but similar to those reported in the endorse ( epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for vte in the acute hospital care setting ) study ( 69% ) . \\n one of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine ( thrombophilia marker ) in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study . \\n fewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy , which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis . \\n this is supported by the fact that only 1% of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives , and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy . \\n a total of 28% of the overall referrals were from cardiologists . the majority ( 82% ) of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical ( 15% ) specialties as against a referral rate of 93% from surgeons at vellore . \\n our finding complements that from the endorse study in which 55% of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease . majority ( 53% ) of patients in our study had co - morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus ; it is possible that these patients visited a cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment ( s ) and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist ( investigator ) . \\n most ( 89% ) of these patients had swelling of the ( lower ) limb . \\n it is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit a specialist for a symptom like  swelling of limb ,  instead visited their family physician . \\n it is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to a specialist . \\n patients with a history of vte are about 8 times more likely to develop a new episode during a subsequent high - risk period compared with patients without a history of dvt or pe . \\n prior history of dvt was the most ( 34% ) common risk factor in patients who had only dvt , whereas past history of pe , trauma , and immobilization for more than 3 days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe . \\n our results ( major lower limb surgery as a risk factor in 3% patients ) appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study , which reported dvt in 4.4% patients undergoing major lower limb surgery . \\n other studies from india have reported a dvt incidence rate ranging from 8% to 20% in major lower limb surgery . \\n however , in our study , only 7% of patients had malignancy as a predisposing factor . among the malignancies , genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence ( 45% ) . \\n hypertension ( 25% ) was the most common co - morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus ( 19% ) in this patient population . \\n in addition , obesity ( 11% ) was a common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe . \\n our findings support an asian ( korean ) study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 48% patients with vte . \\n co - morbid neurological disease ( other than stroke ) and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt ( 10% ) and pe ( 11% ) respectively . \\n both these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time , predisposing them to vte . \\n venography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively . in our study \\n , venography was used in just 4% patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one - third of the patients . \\n perhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors . \\n overall , most ( 93% ) patients were managed as inpatients ( 39% diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and 54% admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of vte ) . \\n a mean duration of hospitalization of 79 days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data . in selected low - risk patients , outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered . \\n this approach was observed in a small proportion ( 7% ) of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis , nearly all ( 97% ) of whom had only dvt . \\n the reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study ( 15% ) was half of that ( 30% ) reported in vellore registry . \\n this could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites . \\n most ( 40% ; 32/81 ) dvt cases were diagnosed between 2 and 6 postoperative weeks , but pe in most cases ( 70% ; 7/10 ) was diagnosed during the first postoperative week . \\n we notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less ( 6% ; 7/124 ) frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against 18% ( 64/352 ) and 14% ( 10/73 ) of acute dvt alone and pe alone , respectively . \\n the use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines , which recommend at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation ( lmwh , fondaparinux , intravenous ufh , or subcutaneous ufh ) and at least 3 months of long - term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin k antagonist . \\n bleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is a major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient 's age advances . in this registry , \\n anticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% of the study population . \\n the prospective reite registry has reported a rate of 3% for major / fatal bleeds . \\n thus , the fear of bleeding complications , which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment , appears to be minimal . \\n dvt complicated by pe ( 60% ) and pe alone ( 75% ) were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone ( 25% ) . similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was 5% for primary and 14% for secondary diagnosis , we report a hospital readmission rate of 6% ; however we do not know the cause for readmission . \\n the death rate was 7% among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against a rate of 1% among those who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of vte . \\n over 90% of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment . in our study , the hospital discharge rate ( 97% ) was more than triple and death rate was a quarter of that reported by pandey et al . \\n ( hospital discharge rate 31% and death rate 16% ) at a university hospital in delhi . \\n our data show a significant increase in acute dvt ( pe ) from 2006 to 2010 . \\n this can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities , such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted . \\n although there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from 2006 to 2010 , the burden of pe is almost double ( 13% of all vte ) of 7% , rate reported at christian medical college , vellore during a 10-year period from 1996 to 2005 . \\n our finding is consistent with a study from north india that reported a 16% incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies . \\n this study has the expected limitations of any retrospective review including the availability of complete records for all patients , although a robust review of the data on medical charts was conducted . \\n controlling for bias and confounders is difficult as there is no randomization and no blinding . \\n follow - up data of patients after hospital discharge were not available . in cases of death , \\n further , the clinic charts reviewed in this study included a mix of those from vascular surgery and hematology departments , limiting the generalizability of the study results . despite these limitations , \\n this study provides large amount of useful information in a short span of time on patient characteristics , clinical outcomes , management strategies , and temporal trends in vte , based on  real world \\n data that reflect actual day - to - day clinical practice over a period of 5 years across three sites in india . \\n we believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment , to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india . \\n real world data reflecting actual day - to - day clinical practice in vte over a period of 5 years across three sites in india showed that vte is not uncommon in indian patients and that acute dvt was responsible for the substantial burden of vte . \\n we believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment , to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india . \\n liesel c. dsilva is and dr . sadhna j. joglekar was full -

            "Article: venous thromboembolism vte comprising of deep vein thrombosis dvt and pulmonary embolism pe can result in significant mortality morbidity and healthcare expenditure approximately one third of patients with symptomatic vte manifests pe whereas two thirds manifest dvt alone both dvt and pe can be clinically silent asymptomatic and hence not suspected if undiagnosed asymptomatic vte can lead to chronic venous disease or recurrent vte and long term debilitating sequelae such as postthrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension vte is not only disabling but also prolongs hospital stay and increases the cost of treatment along with myocardial infarction and arrhythmia due to electrolyte imbalance pe is one of the commonest causes of sudden unexplained deaths in hospitalized patients it is estimated that 20 million cases of lower extremity dvt occur in the usa alone the prevailing notion that the incidence of vte in asians is less than that in the western population has been disproved by recent studies the incidence of postoperative dvt in indian patients undergoing major lower limb surgery is as high 43.2% and 60% patients in the groups with and without prophylaxis respectively as seen in the western world given the growing burden of vte in india and lack of substantial indian data on characteristics of vte patients use of diagnostics tools prophylaxis treatment options and clinical outcomes in vte there was need to systematically collect such data data on patient characteristics clinical outcomes predictors of mortality in acute dvt management strategies and temporal trends in vte the intent was to collect and provide data that would reflect actual day to day clinical practice rather than results of highly controlled clinical trials with restricted study populations and imposed experimental intervention consecutive medical records of inpatients and outpatients between january 2006 and december 2010 meeting eligibility criteria confirmed diagnosis of acute or acute on chronic dvt by doppler ultrasound scan and/or pe by chest computed tomography scan pulmonary angiography or scan were identified and collected from the general medical records and/or radiology departments at each of the three participating hospitals hospital data were used to obtain the total number of patients who were annually registered at the hospital from 2006 to 2010 data were processed and analyzed using sas version 9.1 statistical analysis system for the purpose of analysis acute on chronic descriptive statistics were used to present patient characteristics management strategies and clinical outcomes of patients annual incidence rates 95% ci of vte per 100 000 hospital registrations over period of years were reported for each site

to analyse trends in the incidence rates in acute dvt pe and pe alone as there were zero observations in some instances incidence of acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism over years period 20062010 at three sites to our knowledge this is the first multicenter retrospective registry in india involving patients with vte that reflect real world clinical practice in contrast with the western data in which vte is predominantly disease of older age 44% patients in our study were between 40 and 59 years of age while 34% were below 40 years particularly those with pe in study from north india men constituted 70% of our registry more than those reported from vellore registry 48% but similar to those reported in the endorse epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for vte in the acute hospital care setting study 69% one of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine thrombophilia marker in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study fewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis this is supported by the fact that only 1% of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy total of 28% of the overall referrals were from cardiologists the majority 82% of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical 15% specialties as against referral rate of 93% from surgeons at vellore our finding complements that from the endorse study in which 55% of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease majority 53% of patients in our study had co morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus it is possible that these patients visited cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist investigator most 89% of these patients had swelling of the lower limb it is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit specialist for symptom like swelling of limb instead visited their family physician it is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to specialist patients with history of vte are about times more likely to develop new episode during subsequent high risk period compared with patients without history of dvt or pe prior history of dvt was the most 34% common risk factor in patients who had only dvt whereas past history of pe trauma and immobilization for more than days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe our results major lower limb surgery as risk factor in 3% patients appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study which reported dvt in 4.4% patients undergoing major lower limb surgery other studies from india have reported dvt incidence rate ranging from 8% to 20% in major lower limb surgery however in our study only 7% of patients had malignancy as predisposing factor among the malignancies genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence 45% hypertension 25% was the most common co morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus 19% in this patient population in addition obesity 11% was common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe our findings support an asian korean study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 48% patients with vte co morbid neurological disease other than stroke and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt 10% and pe 11% respectively both these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time predisposing them to vte venography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively in our study venography was used in just 4% patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one third of the patients perhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors overall most 93% patients were managed as inpatients 39% diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and 54% admitted to hospital with diagnosis of vte mean duration of hospitalization of 79 days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data in selected low risk patients outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered this approach was observed in small proportion 7% of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis nearly all 97% of whom had only dvt the reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study 15% was half of that 30% reported in vellore registry this could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites most 40% 32/81 dvt cases were diagnosed between and postoperative weeks but pe in most cases 70% 7/10 was diagnosed during the first postoperative week we notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less 6% 7/124 frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against 18% 64/352 and 14% 10/73 of acute dvt alone and pe alone respectively the use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines which recommend at least days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation lmwh fondaparinux intravenous ufh or subcutaneous ufh and at least months of long term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin antagonist bleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient age advances in this registry anticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% of the study population the prospective reite registry has reported rate of 3% for major fatal bleeds thus the fear of bleeding complications which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment appears to be minimal dvt complicated by pe 60% and pe alone 75% were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone 25% similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was 5% for primary and 14% for secondary diagnosis we report hospital readmission rate of 6% however we do not know the cause for readmission the death rate was 7% among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against rate of 1% among those who were hospitalized with diagnosis of vte over 90% of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment in our study the hospital discharge rate 97% was more than triple and death rate was quarter of that reported by pandey et al hospital discharge rate 31% and death rate 16% at university hospital in delhi our data show significant increase in acute dvt pe from 2006 to 2010 this can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted although there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from 2006 to 2010 the burden of pe is almost double 13% of all vte of 7% rate reported at christian medical college vellore during 10-year period from 1996 to 2005 our finding is consistent with study from north india that reported 16% incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies this study has the expected limitations of any retrospective review including the availability of complete records for all patients although robust review of the data on medical charts was conducted controlling for bias and confounders is difficult as there is no randomization and no blinding follow up data of patients after hospital discharge were not available in cases of death further the clinic charts reviewed in this study included mix of those from vascular surgery and hematology departments limiting the generalizability of the study results despite these limitations this study provides large amount of useful information in short span of time on patient characteristics clinical outcomes management strategies and temporal trends in vte based on real world data that reflect actual day to day clinical practice over period of years across three sites in india we believe that this information will serve as guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india real world data reflecting actual day to day clinical practice in vte over period of years across three sites in india showed that vte is not uncommon in indian patients and that acute dvt was responsible for the substantial burden of vte we believe that this information will serve as guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis

            "Article: there is an epidemic of stroke in low and middle income countries due to rapidly increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors such as hypertension diabetes mellitus dyslipidaemia the need has thus arisen to conduct studies aimed at epidemiologic genetic and phenotypic characterisation of stroke in sub saharan africa to provide evidence based information to confront this menace to this end it is important that controls selected for comparison with cases are recruited with high degree of certainty that they indeed do not have stroke or tia to allow for valid comparisons to be made in view of this simple quick and accurate assessment of symptoms of stroke is needed for epidemiologic studies particularly those of the case control type in 2000 meschia et al developed the questionnaire for verifying stroke free status qvsfs as method for verifying the stroke free phenotype in participants of clinical epidemiological and genetic studies having one or more affirmative answers to any of the questionnaire was associated with finding stroke tia or either stroke or tia on medical record review jones et al showed by directly interviewing participants and review of medical records that the qvsfs had nppv and ppv of 0.96 and 0.71 respectively making the 8-item qvsfs sensitive and valid tool and structured telephone interview format of questionnaire administration still had an excellent sensitivity of 1.0 specificity of 0.86 positive predictive value of 0.36 and negative predictive value of 1.0 among participants aged 60 years and above the qvsfs is also reliable with intra rater and inter rater agreement of stroke free status classification of 0.90 and 0.94 respectively the qvsfs is easy to administer as self report pencil and paper questionnaire or by an interview in person or by telephone and has been translated into spanish by castillo et al for use among hispanic populations two questions in the instrument assess previous diagnosis of either stroke tia together with six questions about stroke symptoms thus not only is the 8-item qvsfs useful tool in identifying stroke free individuals but it could be used to screen for undiagnosed stroke the sensitivity and specificity of having any of the six symptom questions for stroke detection was 0.82 and 0.62 respectively indeed the qvsfs has been successfully used in the recruitment of controls involved genetic studies into ischaemic stroke to screen for cerebrovascular end points in the carotid revascularisation endarterectomy versus stent trial crest and in the reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke regards study this instrument could have tremendous potential in developing countries where stroke prevalence is increasing awareness of stroke symptoms low and the confirmation of stroke diagnosis either missed by health workers or constrained by the pervasive lack of neuro imaging modalities in these low literacy settings the lack of knowledge of stroke symptoms might impact negatively on the performance of stroke symptom questionnaires furthermore there is lack of specific medical terminology for symptoms of stroke in local dialects across sub saharan africa the performance of the questionnaire could be enhanced further by the introduction of culturally acceptable pictures of stroke symptoms one of the key comments regarding the 8-item qvsfs questionnaire is that the benchmark for verification of strokes has relied on review of medical records of patients but this approach may be problematic in settings where medical records are kept under less than optimal circumstances and where patients may not always seek health services for ailments from medical facilities but from herbalists chemical shops and so forth an approach to overcome this limitation would be to examine participants by neurologists or to use cranial ct scan for verification in subset of participants this study seeks to validate the 8-item qvsfs at centers in nigeria and ghana which are involved in the on going nih supported stroke investigative research and educational networks siren study participants will be recruited from

participants of clinical epidemiological and genetic studies however the performance of this tool in settings where levels of education and awareness of stroke symptoms are low such as sub saharan africa has not been conducted the tool has tremendous potential for widespread use in regions such as ours where stroke incidence prevalence and mortality are escalating and questions on the epidemiology and genetic underpinnings of the stroke epidemic remain unresolved we propose to validate qvsfs for ascertainment of stroke free status of control subjects enrolled in an ongoing stroke epidemiological study in west africa funded by the national institute of health for h3africa the novel aspects of our validation study are firstly to carry out this validation study simultaneously at five tertiary hospitals across nigeria and ghana involving participants speaking three different languages yoruba hausa and akan the qvsfs will be translated into these languages and administered to participants enrolled from neurology and general clinics in these hospitals secondly given the low levels of education the lack of awareness of stroke symptoms and general paucity of semantically equivalent medical terminology in the local dialects for stroke symptoms in our settings we will evaluate the performance of the tool with and without pictograms finally ascertainment of stroke status will be conducted by neurologists across the sites using combination of structured medical history neurological examination review of medical records and neuro imaging gold standard compared with previously published studies which relied on medical records review and neurological examination the 8-item qvsfs is simple accurate and cheap tool which could have widespread use for ascertaining

            "Article: cardiovascular diseases account for the highest mortality rate worldwide and are expected to be the major cause of death by 2020 studies in iran showed that cardiovascular diseases are the most important cause of death and accounted for 42% of all deaths in 2002 timely diagnosis and proactive measures play significant role in effective treatment prevention development of heart damages and the faster recovery of cardiovascular diseases the time it takes to reach hospital or coronary care unit ccu and the time spent for diagnostic and treatment measures are factors influencing the delay or loss of time from the outset of severe cardiac infarction to the beginning of treatment overall the mortality rate of severe cardiovascular deaths is 30% more than half of which occurs before hospitalization however with the advancement of the epidemic this social trend reverses and people at lower socio economic classes become more vulnerable studies conducted in some developing countries showed that the underprivileged are more susceptible to cardiac arrests compared to affluent people furthermore limited accessibility to health services and the inequality in availability of the services furnished by health and treatment systems deprives these people of acceptable and effective treatment limited and unequal accessibility to health services in iran are one of the controversial issues mentioned in several studies in general one of the most important goals of health system is to provide public accessibility and equality in receiving health and treatment services as one measure of development accessibility to health is one of the basic rights of individuals in the society one of the main points in meting out fairness in the health system is that the distribution of health services must not be based on the socio economic status and incomes of individuals inequality in health services in different countries has taken the form of global challenge affected by various factors including individual social economic and geographical variables these factors are stronger in developing countries 10 so that distribution of health services resources in developing countries has turned into fundamental issue therefore the measurement of fair distribution of health services on top of previous measures has been emphasized by world health organization who 11 inequality in distribution of health services is measured by different scales one of the most common is the gini coefficient which is based on the lorenz curve 12 although multiple measures of inequality have been shown to be highly correlated with each other 12 the results of several studies are encouraging and confirming the utility of the gini index in quantifying inequalities in health related subjects thus the gini index and lorenz curve are commonly used in analyzing the inequality in distribution of health care resources 13 16 since accessibility to intensive healthcare in particular for cardiovascular conditions is of utmost importance and since the appropriate distribution of coronary care unit ccu beds and cardiologists can be taken as measure the present study aims to examine the inequality of the geographical distribution of ccu beds and cardiologists in iran using the gini coefficient and the lorenz curve this study conducted useing demographic data from national census in 2012 collected by the statistics center of iran sci the number of ccu beds and cardiologists in public sector by province in 2012 was obtained from iran ministry of health and medical education in the present study among various possible inequality measures such as gini coefficient decile ratio robin hood index and atkinson index preference was given to the gini coefficient because it has at least three major advantages 17 first it is less sensitive to the number of regions and the size of the numerical values in the data material in general third gini coefficient can be presented visually by means of lorenz curve which provides an effective visualization of the inequalities the lorenz curve compares the distribution of given variable with the normal distribution of same variable that represents equality the grater gap between the lorenz curve and diagonal line means the higher inequality in this curve the axis represents the cumulative percentage of population and the axis shows the percentage of the variable which is expressed as the proportion of the cumulative population the 45-degree line is called the equality line because of showing the completely equal distribution in our study the axis represents the cumulative percentage of population of iranian provinces and the axis shows the cumulative frequency of cardiologists and ccu beds in the iranian provinces the gini coefficient is defined as the division of the area between diagonal line and the lorenz curve 14 mathematically speaking g1=1k=1n xkxk1 yk+yk1 where represents the cumulative percentage of the population and represents the cumulative percentage of ccu beds and cardiologists the gini coefficient ranges between and in which theoretically represents complete equality and shows complete inequality of the distribution of given variable in practice however coefficient below 0.2 is considered complete equality one ranging between 0.2 and 0.3 shows high equality one ranging between 0.3 and 0.4 indicates inequality coefficient varying between 0.4 and 0.6 indicates high inequality and coefficient larger than 0.6 represents complete inequality 14 in this study it is assumed that more cardiologist and ccu beds are associated with more access to cardiovascular health services so that people in provinces with higher per capital level of cardiologist and ccu beds have more access to cardiovascular health resources services finally in order to calculate gini coefficient the demographic data and also the number of ccu beds and cardiologists by province were entered and analyzed through ms excel software in 2012 iran had total population of 75 149 669 with total number of 3665 ccu beds and the total number of 953 cardiologists in public sector the province of tehran had the largest percentage of ccu beds 23.7% and cardiologists 17% there were respectively 4.8 and 1.3 ccu beds and cardiologists across the nation per 100 000 individuals table shows the number of cardiologists and ccu beds per 100 000 individuals and the number of cardiologists per 10 ccu beds by province in 2012 the lorenz curves for the ccu beds and cardiologists are illustrated in figures and2 the gini coefficients obtained for ccu beds and cardiologists were 0.129 and 0.045 respectively the findings showed that the national mean number of ccu beds for population of 100 000 is 4.88 which 23 out of total of 31 provinces are below the national mean however the obtained gini coefficients prove statically adequate equality for the geographical distribution of ccu beds across iran previous study showed that the province of yazd enjoys the most equal distribution of ccu beds on one hand and the province of ilam suffers from the least equal distribution of ccu beds 16 study on distribution of active hospital bed in iran reported the gini coefficient for active bed 0.08 and active beds for population of 10 000 people in 2006 9.2 while the province of yazd had maximum and the province of lorestan the minimum beds per population 18 another study conducted in 2002 using morris imbalance coefficient showed the province of yazd stands at the highest rank in terms of the number of hospital beds and the province of semnan ranks the highest in terms of the number of health centers 19 study conducted in the netherlands on the distribution of ccu beds in 24 university hospitals for the period 2004 2006 reported gini coefficients of 0.638 0.569 and 0.569 which reflected unequal distribution 20 study conducted at 2006 reflects equal distribution of non cardiac intensive care beds in iran the numbers of icu post icu and nicu beds per 100 000 individuals in iran reported 5.3 0.4 and 1.6 respectively and the gini coefficient for icu post icu and nicu beds 0.17 0.15 and 0.23 14 another study conducted at 2011 showed high degree of inequality in the distribution of kidney transplant beds in iran the province of tehran had more than half of the beds installed in its hospitals while 17 provinces had no kidney transplant beds at all in south africa there were 168 icu beds counted in 2005 of which 86% were installed in three provinces the proportion of bed varied greatly in different provinces of this country from 1:20 000 to 1:80 000 21 the distribution of secondary and tertiary health services in the palestine is also reported to be unequal mostly concentrated in the downtown in the gaza strip and in the eastern strip the proportions of iu beds per 000 were 1.4 and 1.2 respectively 22 in another study in the u.s.a the trend of gini coefficient during 1970 1997 was used to measure the distribution of hospital beds the northern states have been reported to enjoy an equal distribution of hospital beds 15 lorenz curve of ccu beds in 2012 lorenz curve of cardiologists in 2012 the present study findings showed that the mean number of cardiologists per 100 000 individuals is 1.27 also the mean number of cardiologists per 10 ccu is 2.6 which 13 provinces are below the national mean out of total of 31 provinces the obtained gini coefficient 0.045 proves statically adequate equality in the geographical distribution of cardiologists across iran study conducted on the distribution of specialist physicians in iran at 2010 showed that the numbers of total specialists per 10 000 individuals and per 10 active beds in the country were 1.7 and 1.9 respectively and the gini coefficient of distribution of total specialists reported 0.052 18 the gini coefficient was used in study at 2000 to measure the resource distribution in mental health services in the us showing the gini coefficient for psychologists as 0.13 15 in another study in japan gini coefficient was used to measure equality in geographical distribution of orthopedic services findings showed the orthopedist per 100 000 individuals was 4.3 and the gini coefficient reported 0.36 23 the low gini coefficients obtained in this study suggest that the health system in iran has been relatively successful in establishing fair geographical distribution of coronary care services which can be attributed to the implementation of the fair national health services distribution strategic plan iran is the first east mediterranean country to implement this strategic health plan as its fourth development plan and through iran 20-year vision plan in the health services department 24 furthermore in 1992 comprehensive program the health services classification system was developed in order to avoid unnecessary parallel activities create fairness in the distribution of inpatient health services make accessible the health services to all people across the country reduce the number of unused beds and develop health services classification system on the basis of different specialties and their respective stations by province variables such as patient admission population mean hospital stay length national divisions available facilities and the geographical situation in terms of route and accessibility were determining factors in locating health centers 24 25 for instance the maximum accessibility time to ccu bed is set at 30 minutes therefore if the temporal distance of province to the next level of numerical reference shows time length longer than 30 minutes the calculated beds which may even be below the installation basis would belong to that province and would not be transferred 26 reports show that in the 2006 2007 687 ccu beds were installed in iran indicating the iranian health system approach to promote health and create the conditions for the fair accessibility of health systems to all citizens 27 our study descriptive statistics showed skewed distribution of ccu beds in iran so that the capital tehran accommodating one sixth of the total population of iran owns one fourth of total ccu beds in iran in similar study by ameryoun et al on the non cardiac intensive care beds in tehran the ratios of all non cardiac intensive care beds were almost two times higher than other provinces 14 also in another study by tofighi et al on the distribution of specialists tehran owns 23% of all specialists across the country 18 however study conducted in 2002 19 showed that by morris measure the health centers in tehran do not constitute balanced distribution burdened with problems such as traffic jams and other problems rampant in metropolitan cities causing delays and waste of time from the beginning of acute myocardial infarction symptoms to the initiation of treatment accessibility to the ccu bed furthermore problems such as overcrowded hospitals in tehran drop in quality and quantity of health services inadequacy of services on one hand and waste of funds for the provinces and finally drop in public health on the other hand are other problems plaguing megacities therefore health policy makers should emphasize decentralization in tehran and identify extra health facilities in different cities so that balanced allocation of resources may be achieved fair geographical distribution of health services would lead to efficient and cost effective health system while existing classificatory models in iran focus on structural development the number of beds and model of providing health services few studies have concentrated on the distribution by area classification and defining areas on the basis of optimal distribution of health services 26 therefore current study may provide foundation for large scale planning for the health systems in order to remove the inequality in the distribution of health services further research and surveys are strongly recommended to acquire more information and monitor the fairness of distribution of different health systems nationally and across provinces the aforementioned results represent an initial empirical approximation the validity of which is limited for the following reasons first counting the number of cardiologists and ccu beds is not an appropriate way to measure extant cardiovascular care and access to it more sufficient reliable measure in iran is not available yet second the methodology used to measure inequality is not perfect and biased with limitations in measuring inequality for example utilizing the gini coefficient showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran though primary information on the distribution of beds and cardiologists showed that about one fourth of the ccu beds are existed in tehran where one sixth of the total population of iran is living such interpretations are helpful for providing an approximation of existing distributions and can show some limitations of using inequality measures despite the fact that the present study is one of the few studies conducted on the geographical distribution of one health services cardiovascular health services in iran selecting only two factors the number of beds and physicians in the distribution of facilities and administering only one measure the gini coefficient may be considered as the limitations of this study also because of the unavailability of private sector and province specific data the research did not consider the private sector capacity and could not produce detailed provincial results which are hoped to be overcome in future studies measuring equality in distribution of private sector resources or all the private and public resources together could have extremely different results using gini measure showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran nevertheless our descriptive statistics showed that there is skewness in distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran moreover even the equal distribution of cardiovascular health facilities such as ccu beds does not mean they are sufficiently provided in iran.\n",
            "Abstract: background timely access to cardiovascular health services is necessary to prevent heart damages the present study examined inequality in geographical distribution of cardiovascular health services in iran methods present study is cross sectional study conducted using demographic data from all iranian provinces 31 provinces from 2012 census by the statistics center of iran sci the gini coefficients of ccu beds and cardiologists were used to assess equality in access to cardiovascular health services in iran ms excel software was used to calculate gini coefficients results the proportions of ccu bed and cardiologist per 100 000 population were 4.88 and 1.27 respectively also the gini coefficients were 0.129 and 0.045 respectively conclusion descriptive statistics showed skewness in distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran though gini coefficient revealed no significant inequality however equal distribution of ccu beds and cardiovascular specialists does not mean they are sufficiently available in iran.\n",

tuberculosis beijing and east african indian eai genotype strains strains each originating from vietnam statistical analysis was performed by using an unpaired mann whitney test for beijing genotype strains the increase in mutation frequency during exposure to rif could be due to described missense mutations in the mut genes 13 such mutations in the mut genes can change the dna repair mechanism as consequence the frequency of resistant mutant formation might increase however direct correlation between the occurrence of particular mutations in mut genes and altered mutation frequency has not been proven furthermore werngren and hoffner 14 found an equal mutation frequency for beijing 3.6 10 and non beijing 4.4 10 genotypes possible explanation for the discrepancy in findings might be the concentration of rif used in the subculture plates in our study the critical concentration of mg rif was used 11 whereas werngren and hoffner used concentration of mg rif in addition werngren and

            "Article: the need for magnetic resonance imaging mri in patients with an implanted pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd is growing clinical issue it is estimated that as many as 75% of active cardiac device recipients will become indicated for mri currently the vast majority of such devices are contraindicated for use with an mri in european heart rhythm association survey published recently for non mri certified icds 0.51.5 field strength the totally subcutaneous icd icd system an implantable defibrillator with no leads that touch the heart has recently been demonstrated to be safe and effective defibrillator option for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death it provides shock therapy and post shock pacing therapy but no long term bradycardia pacing although it has been shown as an alternative to the standard transvenous icd its compatibility with mri remains unclear various types of clinical mri systems currently use superconductive magnet that creates static magnetic field strength typically 1.5 or the use of mri with most pacemakers and icds is considered contraindication due to potential hazards including heating of the electrode that resides in or on the heart damage to myocardium elevation of pacing thresholds unintended induction of ventricular tachycardia vt or ventricular fibrillation vf pacing inhibition permanent device malfunction and distortion of the mri scan recently mr conditional mr conditional indicates lack of known hazards in specified mri environment with specified conditions of use due to the variety of mri scanners and scanning protocols it is not practical to test even single device under all conditions hence mr conditional labelling dictates that the device is safe for use under certain scanning conditions as well as how the cardiac device should be programmed before an exposure to the magnetic field in mri scanner the literature although limited provides some guidance for imaging patients with implanted pacemakers or icds that do not have mr conditional labelling this single centre prospective non controlled study describes the first use of mri in patients with an implanted icd patients with implanted icd systems boston scientific sqrx model 1010 and trak model 3010 were enrolled for mri testing over period of 18 months the icd system implanted in this

patients reported no sensation or pain from heating of the can two of 15 patients reported feeling some heating and two patients reported intolerable heating see table in patients with intolerable heating the scan was halted within seconds and changed to scan of the brain which proceeded without incident patient reports of heating in the vicinity of the can occurred only during lumbar scans with thermistor probe no such reports occurred during scans of the brain cardiac area cervical spine or without the probe in two cases where heating in the vicinity of the can was reported by the patient the scan sequence was altered to reduce the intensity of radiofrequency rf field exposure by reducing the turbo factor e.g from 21 to increasing the repetition time e.g to 4000 ms and reducing the flip angle e.g from 170 to 120 the target values were chosen arbitrarily to maintain image contrast flip angle and keep scan time at reasonable limits turbo factor and repetition time less heating was noted by patients after these modifications to the scan parameters were made 03 was observed to have skin lesion appearing to be circular rash or ulcer on the surface of the skin over the can approximately 35 mm in diameter the cause of this skin anomaly is not known it was later noted to have fully healed at follow up 10 days after the scan to ascertain the effect of heating due to the instrumented thermistor catheter the two patients who experienced the heating examinations and 16 see table were rescanned several weeks later without the thermistor catheter in place examinations 11 and 17 first modified sequence with even lower amount of energy deposited in the tissue was used which caused no heating as no sensation was reported by the subjects they were asked to report even minimal discomfort and the lumbar scans were performed using the same settings that resulted in heating with the thermistor catheter in place in the first imaging session the results of the rescans revealed that no heating was felt by the patients when the thermistor catheter was absent there were no noted changes to battery voltage ability to detect the qrs signal or stored diagnostic data pacing thresholds can not be assessed by the icd system so this was not evaluated none of the patients reported any pulling or twisting of the can or pain from heating of the icd electrode for scans of the brain lumbar spine knee and cervical spine no effect from image artefact was noted in the anatomical area of interest however for scans of the cardiac area image artefact was noted to interfere with the ability to see parts of the left ventricle though the right ventricle of the heart was unaffected and could be imaged usefully this was due to the can and not the electrode see figure

limited reports about mr conditional icds biotronik announced in late 2011 release of their first mr compatible icd device and defibrillator leads pro mri but in the conditions of use excluded scanning of the torso and focused more on the extremities examination in european heart rhythm association survey 60% of centres did not implant any mri certified icds 34.3% implanted 10 icd devices and only 5.6% implanted 10 and more icds one fifth of responders stated that mri certified icds should be implanted in all patients but lack of reimbursement was indicated as possible obstacle to implant more mri certified pacemakers icds by 47.1% of responding centres none of the components of the icd system are on or in the heart the icd depends less upon being in direct contact with the myocardium to function and instead uses far field sensing and stimulation to provide the shock and post shock pacing therapy as consequence unlike transvenous systems heating near or around the electrode can not harm the myocardium which could present with possible safety consequences such as an elevation in pacing thresholds or scarring of the myocardium but it may still cause serious patient discomfort because the icd is larger than modern transvenous icd there may be more potential for the can to experience heating due to the magnetic gradient or rf field we report results from what we believe is the first experience of mri scanning in patients with an implanted icd and in various anatomical areas overall mri was performed safely in all patients which is in contrast to the current literature with mri imaging in patients with electrical active devices which are not mri conditional in our study the primary clinically significant event attributable to the mri scan was the occurrence of heating in the area of the pocket in the four patients that underwent lumbar scans it was not known if this was due to the icd can itself or an artefact of the thermistor catheter used to measure skin temperature over the pocket this required revision of our protocol which was to re scan two of the patients who complained of heating re scanning of these patients without the thermistor probe resulted in no complaints of heating so it is assumed that the thermistor catheter itself heated during the lumbar scans and caused the discomfort as further evidence all the heating complaints occurred during rf intensive scan sequences namely fast spin echo with the temperature probe located axially near the centre of the bore where rf fields are the highest the thermistor catheter is constructed of insulated conductive cables connected to electrodes and should couple to the rf fields efficiently causing heating at the electrodes and pain or damage on the surface of the skin where the probe was placed over the icd can if the heating was due to the icd can itself it would more likely occur during gradient intensive scan sequences which can generate eddy currents on can surfaces and internal components and at locations in the bore where there are high gradient fields such as near the bore edges however when the patient was scanned with gradient intensive scan sequences e.g flair dwi and with the icd system in high gradient field locations in the bore e.g such as during brain scan patients did not detect any heating or discomfort in addition the subcutaneous lead which was not instrumented with thermistor catheter never resulted in any heating sensation noted by the patient even when exactly the same sequence that resulted in heating in the first session was used the use of mri compatible temperature monitors such as fibre optic temperature probes would have provided better confirmation of possible skin temperature elevation and would not have been affected by the rf fields for cardiac imaging the main problem to solve is metallic artefact especially on the gradient echo sequences like in research performed by nazarian et al several scan protocols were used to see if any yielded different effects or reduced the qualitative extent of artefact gradient mode was changed from normal to whisper resulting in slower ramping of the field and therefore diminishing the changes of the magnetic field in time artefacts when present were limited to blurring of the left ventricle during cardiac scans and most yielded clinically useful information standard interrogation of the icd revealed no adverse effects upon the functioning of the system while no adverse effects upon the post scan icd device function were noted not all possible scanning protocols were tested it should be noted that four of the icd were exposed to repeat mri scans without adverse effects to device function in addition because the icd does not provide long term bradycardia pacing it is assumed that pacemaker dependent patients would not be implanted with this system the inhibition of the pacemaker function during the scanning sequence and possible pacing threshold changes are unique concern in patients implanted with transvenous icds this study included only 15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5 mri scanner thus even these preliminary results should only be applied to 1.5 mri scanners similarly as reported in the present literature for other implantable devices device functionality was tested immediately after the scan but not for long term effects in addition not all device functions were tested although the icd system does have beeper interrogation warning if battery levels or memory irregularities occur however patients were scheduled for regular check up and no defect of the device was observed in following 725 months mean observation time 18 months delayed enhancement mri for determining cardiac scarring was also not tested also there are other anatomical areas that were not evaluated such as shoulder and knees this study included only 15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5 mri scanner thus even these preliminary results should only be applied to 1.5 mri scanners similarly as reported in the present literature for other implantable devices device functionality was tested immediately after the scan

was also not tested also there are other anatomical areas that were not evaluated such as shoulder and knees while more data are required to support claim of mri conditional this study is the study to demonstrate the feasibility of exposing icd patients to mri using the scanning and monitor protocol described with some precautionary measures including programming the device therapy off ii limiting the sar to 2.0 kg iii continuous monitoring of the patients pulse oximetry and ecg by qualified personnel and especially for any feelings of heating iv evaluate device function post scan availability of full resuscitation facilities at the mri site given the variables of different mri scanners the decision to perform mri on patients with an implanted icd system should be balanced against the potential risks in our study the only heating was very likely introduced by not fully mri compatible thermometer probe subjects rescanned without the probe did not report any abnormalities during the scan of any body area listed brain cervical and lumbar spine heart and knee this study was supported by iga mz nt12094/2011 research project charles university in prague prvouk p34 and unce

understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices remains meager and lags far behind that of depression overall neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance for example higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini mental state exam mmse as well as tests of memory and executive functions e.g attention 1014 likewise apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction 10 1523 however few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd one study showed strong negative relationship between anxiety both state and trait and overall cognitive performance measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index within sample of 27 pd patients furthermore trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans i.e immediate memory visuospatial construction language attention and delayed memory two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left sided dominant pd lpd versus right sided dominant pd rpd however their findings were inconsistent the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety whereas the second study reported that in lpd apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks e.g tmt wms iii spatial span while in rpd anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks e.g clock reading test and boston naming test furthermore anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions taken together it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning it is also striking that to date no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory 26 27 we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety furthermore since previous work albeit limited has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition we also explored this relationship seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study see table the cross sectional data from these participants was taken from patient database that has been compiled over the past years since 2008 at the parkinson disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre university of sydney inclusion criteria involved diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson disease society brain bank criteria and were confirmed by neurologist sjgl patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed full neuropsychological assessment ten patients in this study pd with anxiety pd without anxiety were taking psychotropic drugs i.e benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders such as anxiety or if they reported score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale hads thus all participants who scored within depressed hads range were excluded from this study in attempt to examine refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney and written informed consent was obtained from all participants self reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd cut off score of on the anxiety subscale of the hads hads was used to identify pd cases with anxiety pda+ while cut off score of on the hads was used to identify pd cases without anxiety pda this criterion was more stringent than usual cut off score in effort to create distinct patient groups the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr stages and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson disease rating scale updrs in similar way this was determined by calculating total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 voluntary movement items 3643 and tremor items 5057 from the mds updrs part iii see table processing speed was assessed using the trail making test part tmt score attentional set shifting was measured using the trail making test part tmt score working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale iii raw scores language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test cowat animals and letters score the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale iii lm

whitney test depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions chi square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups all analyses employed an alpha level of 0.05 and were two tailed spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions as expected the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads 0 0.001 and higher total score on the hads p 0.001 compared to the pda group table groups were matched in age 48 1.31 0.20

neither semantic verbal fluency 47 0.70 0.49 nor phonemic verbal fluency 47 0.39 0.70 differed between groups logical memory immediate recall test 176 0.059 showed trend that the pda+ group had worse

were also no differences between groups in global cognition mmse 222.5 0.23 participants were split into lpd and rpd and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda importantly the groups remained matched in age disease duration updrs iii dde stage and depression but remained significantly different on self reported anxiety lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit

retention 75.5 0.39 compared to rpda this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set shifting and working memory in pd more specifically we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part which assessed attentional set shifting on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention and to lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety taken together these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in similar way as seen in young healthy adults 26 27 although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early premotor stages of pd related degeneration 37 38 such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei i.e raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus resp which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions over time chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries 39 40 which play key role in memory and attention recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls therefore chronic stress from anxiety for example may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients however losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd while noradrenaline reuptake blocker atomoxetine has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd 45 46 overall very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits for example lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology thus cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere e.g verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd however this remains controversial it has also been suggested that since anxiety is common feature of left hemisphere involvement 48 49 cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety although these results align with previous research interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd 30 50 in addition our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings based on these limitations our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd additionally the current study employed very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain future studies are encouraged to collect more complex and comprehensive battery from larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants e.g using dsm criteria rather than relying on self reported measures to group participants in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder e.g social anxiety phobias panic disorders and generalized anxiety influences cognitive performance differently in pd one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression although there was trend that the pda+ group self reported higher levels of depression than the pda group all participants included in the study scored on the depression subscale of the hads controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as key shortcoming in the majority of recent work considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd anxiety is key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options moreover anxiety has been suggested to play key role in freezing of gait fog which is also related to attentional set shifting 52 53 future research should examine the link between anxiety set shifting and fog in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be potential therapy for improving fog.\n",
            "Abstract: research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson disease pd has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly 50% of patients and its negative impact on quality of life previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients however to date no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety 17 pda+ 33 pda who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains simple attention visuomotor processing speed executive function e.g set shifting working memory language and memory new verbal learning results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part of the trail making task tmt compared to the pda group there were no group differences in verbal fluency logical memory or tmt performance in conclusion anxiety in pd has measurable impact on working memory and attentional set shifting.\n",

            "Article: small non coding rnas are transcribed into mrna but remain untranslated in eukaryotic cells they include sirna small interfering rna mirna microrna pirna piwi interacting rna and snorna small nucleolar rna mirnas are class of multifunctional singled stranded small rna which are 20 nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna although over 000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species as many as 000 to 10 000 mirnas per genome have been predicted mirnas regulate broad range of biological processes including timing of development cell cycle progression stem cell self renewal differentiation cancer initiation cancer cell proliferation metastasis and apoptosis 511 cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes although the current treatment of radiation therapy chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur as small non coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis they may represent novel cancer therapy unlike mrna mirnas are transcribed but never translated some mirnas are transcribed from non coding regions between genes deriving from independent transcription unit other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome deriving from the introns of gene transcripts 13 14 mirna gene copy number gain loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array based comparative genomic hybridization the results demonstrated high frequency 72.8% of gene copy number abnormality in mirna containing regions in human breast cancer wang et al collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non tumor tissues mir-21 mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls whereas mir-126 mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples our studies of the mir-17 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node positive compared with node negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via heterotypic signaling although the tendency for global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested general tumor suppressor function of mirnas subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation apoptosis cancer stem cell expansion and tumorigenesis mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type culture conditions target genes and pathway the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently 21 22 le et al described the expression pattern and regulatory network of key mirnas in breast cancer including let-7 mir-34 mir-125 mir-200 family mir-205 mir-21 mir-10 and the mir-17 92 cluster adams et al reviewed the mirna regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation fig 1mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle through targeting different genes and different cyclin cdk complexes mir-17/20 and let-7 regulate the g1-s transition mir-21 and mir-27a

regulate the g1-s transition mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in 50% of breast cancer the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition 23 24 in addition cyclin d1 is critical downstream target of erbb2 ras and -catenin induced breast cancers and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 mir-15/16 mir-23 and let-7 mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation 18 26 the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 92 as well as mir-15/16 was confirmed by deshpande et al the let-7 family functions as tumor suppressor in variety of cancers including lung colon ovarian and breast cancer schultz et al demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor nrf-1 to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis 32 33 furthermore cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle cell growth and epithelial to mesenchymal transition emt in breast cancer mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance facilitating g1-s phase transition thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation 36 37 moreover mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal like breast cancers the breast cancer basal like subtype specific mirnas mir-221 and mir-222 promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance the onco mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in wide variety of cancers including breast cancer 40 41 mir-21 induced cellular proliferation migration invasion emt cancer stem cell characteristics and chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer 42 43 high mir-21 level is associated with poor prognosis advanced stage positive lymph node status and reduced survival time in breast cancer mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death pdcd4 in colon cancer mir-21 participates in dna damage induced g2-m checkpoint through suppressing the cell cycle regulator cdc25a recent report demonstrated the mir-21 regulates the cell cycle through targeting cdc25a in mcf-7 breast cancer cells with potential anti cancer chemical 3-diindolylmethane treatment mir-27a expression is upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines in mda mb-231 cells mir-27a negatively regulated the zinc finger zbtb10 gene and myt-1 thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation mir-27a suppressed myt-1 increased cdc2/cyclin activity and promoted the g2-m checkpoint in mda mb-231 cells thus distinct mirnas affect key genetic targets that govern distinct cell cycle checkpoints including cyclins cdks cdk inhibitors and the g2-m regulation apparatus in addition to cell cycle control breast tumor onset and progression and breast tumor stem cells are also regulated by distinct mirnas cancer stem cells cscs are characterized by their self renewal capacity an ability to differentiate into non tumorigenic cell progeny and their ability to seed tumors when transplanted into animal hosts cell surface markers such as cd44 cd24 cd133 epithelial specific antigen and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 are frequently used to isolate and enrich cscs the involvement of mirnas in regulating tumor formation by cscs or tumor initiating cells ic has been widely investigated let-7 expression is very low to undetectable level in embryonic stem cells es cells and increases with differentiation comparison of mirna expression between breast ic and non ic demonstrated reduced let-7 expression in ic and increased abundance with differentiation transduction of breast cscs with let-7 reduced the proportion of undifferentiated cells inhibited cell proliferation mammosphere formation and tumor formation in vivo clarke and colleagues identified 37 mirnas which were differentially expressed between human breast cscs cd44cd24lineage and lineage nontumorigenic breast cancer cells the mir-200 family members were downregulated in human breast cscs and normal mammary stem progenitor cells expression of mir-200 inhibited breast cancer stem cell expansion in vitro and suppressed the tumor formation ability of human breast cancer stem cell in vivo ectopic mir-34c expression reduced breast ics self renewal inhibited emt and suppressed tumor cell invasiveness via silencing notch4 zhu et al found the reduced mir-128 expression in human breast ic was accompanied by bmi-1 and abcc5 overexpression and associated with chemotherapeutic resistance and poor survival enforced mir-128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin induced apoptosis and dna damage emerging evidence has demonstrated the importance of cscs in cancer initiation cancer metastasis and drug resistance cscs are believed to be one of the most promising targets for cure of cancer the discovery that non coding rnas regulate cscs widens our understanding of cscs and may provide potential novel strategies for breast cancer therapy deletion of chromosome 6q including region 6q14-q16 is frequently observed in breast cancer the small non coding snorna u50 is candidate tumor suppressor gene in the 6q14 16 region playing role in the development and/or progression of breast cancer genomic deletion and transcriptional downregulation of snorna u50 was detected in breast cancer cell lines re expression of snorna u50 inhibited colony formation of the human breast cancer cells hs578 and mda mb-231 pirnas are small non coding rna that form rna protein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins pirna was initially discovered in germ line cells and considered as germ line specific small rnas emerging evidence indicates that pirna expression occurs in somatic cells 57 58 and piwil2 expression has been identified in human breast cancer cells high throughput deep sequencing identified group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines the study of these non coding small rnas in human cancer is just starting the identification of the expression signature of these non coding small rnas in breast cancer subtypes and an understanding of their functional significance to oncogene expression tumor initiation and tumor cell metastasis may shed important new perspectives on the role of these non coding small rnas in breast cancer small non coding rna based diagnostic and therapeutic applications for human cancer are expected in the near future although tumor targeted delivery and local administration are still major challenges to the practical application of gene therapy for cancer mirna based cancer therapeutic approaches are being established and tested in animal models synthetic mirna mimics or mirna expression vectors have been successfully applied to restore or overexpress mirna in vitro chemically modified lna anti sense mirna inhibitor and other approaches have been used to block mirna function in cells kim et al recently reported significant anti tumor effect of virus mediated delivery of mir-145 combined with 5-fu to treat breast cancer intranasal delivery of let-7 and intravenous delivery of mir-34a mimics for non small cell lung cancer treatment and virus mediated delivery of mir-26a for liver cancer treatment in mouse model demonstrate the promise of mirna for treatment of cancer dysregulated expression of mirnas has implicated components of the non coding genome as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors of breast cancer experimental evidence has shown specific mirnas regulating the initiation progression metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer via control of the cell cycle altering cellular proliferation altering cellular apoptosis and/or controlling the population of tumor stem cells dysregulated mirna expression has also been observed in cancer associated fibroblasts caf and in the systemic circulation 65 66 the circulating mirnas have the potential to serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer specific subset of dysregulated mirnas in breast cancer cells may serve as targets for gene therapy either alone or as an adjuvant treatment to current clinical protocols for breast cancer patients.\n",

admitted to the hospital immediately after insertion of the pigtail catheter for management of severe pleural effusion and careful observation one patient was admitted 48 hours after insertion of the pigtail catheter for work up for chest pain all tests were negative navot et al 1992 rizk and aboulghar 1999 but perhaps the most accepted classification of ohss is the one described by golan et al as mild moderate and severe golan et al 1989 however clinicians should be aware that ohss is dynamic condition and moderate ohss may progress to severe ohss within hours rizk and aboulghar 1999 rizk 2009 therefore the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine asrm proposed classification for ohss of mild worsening and serious the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine 2008 recognizing the patients at high risk prevention and early recognition are the most important steps in the management of ohss rizk 2006 however severe forms of ohss especially late onset type that occurs when patients are pregnant most likely will continue to happen albeit at much lower rate unless one reverts to total freeze of all embryos after the use of gnrh agonist as trigger shot in gnrh antagonist cycle donoso and devroey 2013 devroey et al 2011 traditional treatment consists mainly of supportive management until spontaneous resolution occurs rizk 1994 although moderate ohss does not usually require intervention outpatient monitoring is essential to identify progression to severe form rizk 2006 patients with moderate ohss can be managed on an outpatient basis by adequate hydration and close daily monitoring of weight gain and abdominal girth to detect progression to severe ohss and to provide intervention if required rizk 2010 patients presenting with severe forms of ohss are usually managed on inpatient basis and most patients with critical ohss are admitted to intensive care units for aggressive supportive measures to avoid maternal morbidity and mortality the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine 2008 correction of hypovolemia electrolyte imbalance and hypoalbuminemia are the basic principles during the treatment of severe ohss rizk 1994 2006 myrianthefs et al 2000 1992 suggested that paracentesis is the single most important treatment modality in life threatening ohss not controlled by medical therapy paracentesis and removal of ascites result in relieving the pressure on the inferior vena cava and improvement in venous return cardiac output and renal perfusion padilla et al 1990 therefore prompt drainage of fluid produces significant clinical and biochemical improvement including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process abuzeid et al 2003 the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine 2008 it is also possible that removal of ascites decreases the amount of vegf and its effects on vascular permeability therefore ultrasound guided drainage of the ascitic fluid should be performed in severe cases of ohss with respiratory distress oliguria or severe abdominal pain padilla et al 1990 this can be done either trans vaginally aboulghar et al 1990 or trans abdominally padilla et al 1990 however recurrence of ascites is common in severe cases of ohss placement of pigtail catheter has been proposed by some investigators to allow drainage of ascitic fluid whenever it accumulates without the need for further surgical procedures abuzeid et al 2003 in previous study we reported the use of percutaneous pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites in severe ohss as an alternative to repeated paracentesis abuzeid et al 2003 this procedure is relatively simple and requires short period of time as compared to the time needed to gradually aspirate any fluid accumulation transvaginally immediate relief of symptoms and signs of severe ohss after pigtail catheter insertion was an important finding in addition the ease by which any accumulated ascitic fluid was drained resulted in faster resolution of ohss abuzeid et al no infection was reported abuzeid et al 2003 in that study the first 13 patients they were discharged home with the pigtail catheter in place and managed on an outpatient basis until ohss subsided thereafter the catheter was removed the last 13 patients were managed on an outpatient basis without any problem abuzeid mi et al 2003 our previous study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the pigtail catheter for the management of severe ohss therefore we embarked on the current study to evaluate the role of pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with severe ohss syndrome in the current study we demonstrated that patients who were diagnosed very early with severe ohss can be managed safely and effectively on outpatient basis using pigtail catheter drainage iv fluid replacement and careful monitoring although all 33 patients presented with shortness of breath marked abdominal distension nausea weight gain and lower abdominal pain and 13 of them complained of vomiting all are criteria for hospital admission according to the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine on ohss 30 patients were sent home as their presenting symptoms were relieved early diagnosis and intervention resulted in rapid elimination of the symptoms of severe ohss and normalization of vital signs which allow us to manage the patients on outpatient basis the pigtail catheter placements were performed without complications and patients were discharged home after few hours of observation the patients who needed hospital admission were those with associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis another patient was admitted to the hospital for day for work up for chest pain and possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism once pulmonary embolism was ruled out she was discharged home with pigtail catheter in place and she was managed on outpatient basis outpatient management of ohss has no place in those who fail to have complete resolutions of their symptoms or those with severe hyperproteinuria or electrolyte imbalance certainly it has no place in patients with critical ohss such as those with severe pleural effusion diminished urine output severe hemoconcentration and those at increased risk of thromboembolic risks rizk 2010 it is imperative to stress that such protocol can only be used in patients who are motivated reliable and have the necessary support at home to allow them to return to the clinic or go to the emergency room if the need arises it also requires dedicated in vitro fertilization nurses to educate and follow up the patient on daily basis contrary to other reports that state that access to intravenous albumin is critical part of outpatient management for severe ohss we did not use any albumin replacement lincoln et al 2002 the reason behind the use of intravenous albumin is to increase intravascular oncotic pressure thereby curtailing the exodus of free water from the intravascular space in our study we used hespan instead of albumin as some investigators have shown that it is beneficial in reducing the incidence of severe ohss youssef et al 2011 by increasing the intravascular oncotic pressure in addition the majority of our patients had late onset ohss as result of pregnancy hespan should be used with caution in patients with late onset ohss only when benefits outweigh risks.it is fact that outpatient management of early severe ohss is common practice among infertility specialists after trans vaginal aspiration of ascitic fluid and iv fluid hydration outpatient management by repeated abdominal or trans vaginal paracentesis has been reported to be safe effective and cost effective lincoln et al 2002 shrivastav et al 1994 fluker et al 2000 1994 were the first to suggest that day care management in patients with severe ohss with abdominal paracentesis and iv hydration was simple safe and effective compared with traditional treatment with in patient hospitalization and supportive measures 2002 concluded that the need for hospitalization for hyperstimulated patients can be minimized by outpatient management of severe ohss with trans vaginal culdocentesis and rehydration with crystalloids and albumin 2000 advocated in pilot study an active management strategy for moderate ohss which involved early paracentesis designed to minimize the progression from moderate to severe ohss instead of late paracentesis aimed at speeding up recovery in severely ill patients 2010 concluded that early outpatient paracentesis for moderate to severe ohss is the most cost effective management plan when compared with traditional conservative inpatient therapy 2009 reported large series of patients with severe ohss in whom the vast majority were successfully managed as outpatients with use of aggressive trans vaginal paracentesis smith et al 2009 despite the findings in our study it is important to emphasize that ohss remains serious disorder with the potential for rapid deterioration requiring hospitalization and intensive treatment of critically ill patient the life threatening complications of ohss are secondary to thromboembolism or compromised pulmonary or cardiovascular function and multi organ failure there have been isolated reports of women dying from the complications associated with ohss the mortality rate related to ohss is very low and was estimated by brinsden et al more recently reports regarding maternal mortality rates due to ohss in the netherlands and united kingdom demonstrate an incidence of approximately deaths per 100 000 in ivf cycles braat et al 2006 lewis 2007 eleven lethal complications of assisted reproductive technology have been documented and summarized by braat et al several investigators reported sporadic fatality as result of ohss due to adult respiratory distress syndrome massive pulmonary oedema myocardial infarction and carotid artery occlusion resulting in cerebral infarction in this study we describe modified technique of what interventional radiologists usually use for pigtail catheter placement we observed that in the obese patients the metal introducer provided in the pigtail catheter kit is difficult to use instead we used the non disposable gamete intra fallopian treatment trocar and cannula to facilitate the introduction of the catheter through the abdominal wall of such patients this technique helps to manage the patients in the office without the need for sending her to the hospital for an interventional radiologist to place the catheter however the patients in this study were identified from our in vitro fertilization database the study included every patient who developed severe critical ohss in addition the lack of control group that was managed without pigtail catheter placement limits the conclusions that can be drawn from our study in summary drainage of ascitic fluid in patients with severe critical ohss is an important step in the management of this condition rizk 2010 the placement of pigtail catheter resulted in safe and effective outpatient management of the majority of patients with severe ohss however outpatient management of this potentially fatal condition requires clear understanding that rapid deterioration may occur which may necessitate hospitalization and intensive treatment of critically ill patient rizk 2006 2010 patients with critical ohss and those with persistence of symptoms of severe ohss despite insertion of pigtail catheter and drainage of ascitic fluid should be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management.\n",

of islet -cells in type diabetes is mediated by the immune cells particularly autoreactive cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes cells macrophages and dendritic cells in order to obtain insight into type diabetes pathogenic mechanisms in humans and to test novel therapeutic approaches for its treatment different preclinical models of the disease such as spontaneous and accelerated diabetes in the non obese diabetic nod mice biobreeding rats or diabetes induced in susceptible rodent strains by multiple low doses of streptozotocin mlds are now available in the pathogenesis of t1d several proinflamma tory cytokines including ifn tnf il-1 as well as il-17 have been implicated it is also thought that the production of anti inflammatory cytokines such as il-4 il-10 and tgf correlates with protection from t1d it has been shown that some drugs such as pentoxifylline ptx have immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory activity which might represent potential preventive therapy for autoimmune diseases ptx is methyl xanthine derived general phosphodiesterase pde inhibitor that has been available for many years to treat vascular disorder phosphodiesterases pdes are family of enzymes that regulate intracellular levels of the cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp and cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp by catalyzing their breakdown to inactive metabolites drugs that increase the levels of camp tend to reduce the production of proinflammatory mediators and increase the production of anti inflammatory mediators by immune cells in recent years the potential of ptx as an immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory agent gained interest as it has been shown to effectively suppress the synthesis of tnf and other pro inflammatory cytokines such as ifn and il-12 in vitro and in vivo 10 ptx has been successfully used for the treatment of experimental autoimmune diseases including experimental autoimmune myocarditis eam 11 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 12 and

commonly used animal model that has many histological and clinical features similar to those of human type diabetes and involves the participation of macrophages and cells streptozotocin stz is pancreatic cell toxin that induces inflammation of the islets by immune cells when it is given in multiple low doses 16 this model of diabetes offers some advantages such as simultaneous appearance of diabetes mellitus in all animals and not having immune abnormalities that may complicate studies in spontaneous diabetes in non obese diabetic nod mice or bio breeding bb rats therefore this model as good model has been applied extensively to investigate the type diabetes mellitus especially study the immune pathways and modulations of autoimmune insulitis and cell death 17 18 c57bl/6 mice also called c57 black or simply black has the advantage of strain stability and easy breeding the most common application of c57bl/6 mice is to serve as physiological or pathological models for in vivo experiments 19 as such mlds induced c57bl/6j mice were chosen to evaluate the anti hyperglycemic activity of ptx and investigate the immunotherapeutic molecular mechanisms of how ptx attenuated the development of t1d ptx is commonly used for the treatment of microcirculatory disorders and yields only minimal side effects in patients in addition due to its varied immunomodulatory effects ptx has been used in several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis 20 multiple sclerosis 21 and systemic lupus erythematosus 22 drugs that increase the level of camp including pde inhibitors are known to prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses 20 previous studies have also shown that ptx lowers blood glucose levels in diabetic animals 23 and the results from the present studies also indicated that ptx possessed an anti hyperglycemic property more importantly the present data demonstrated that ptx could increase serum insulin concentrations in type diabetic mice it has been shown that ptx could reduce but not abrogate the insulin requirements or lengthen the honeymoon non insulin requiring period in study of 21 children with new onset type 1diabetes 24 helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines tnf ifn il-1 il-6 and il-12 which activate macrophages and cytotoxic cells to destroy -cells whereas anti inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 that are produced by activated helper cells prevent -cell destructive insulitis 25 il-10 has been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in mice 26 in response to cytokine stimulation -cells generate reactive oxygen species ross and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide no which facilitate their destruction 27 no is also synthesized within cytokine activated macrophages by inducible nitric oxide synthase inos 28 more recently the role of il-17-producing cells have been demonstrated in the development of several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and type diabetes il-17 is proinflammatory cytokine that is detrimental to pancreatic islet cells 29 il-17 promotes infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages stimulates the production of other proinflammatory cytokines including tnf il-1 il-6 and il-12 by activated macrophages and induces nitric oxide release from cells that interferes with their function and cause -cell destruction 30 it has been assumed that ptx similar to camp elevating agents selectively suppresses the production of helper type il-2 ifn but not helper type il-4 il-6 il-10 cytokines 31 however it has also been demonstrated that the effect of ptx on cytokine production is cell specific 32 the present study shows that ptx is not only able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines ifn and il-17 but can also increase the production of anti inflammatory cytokines il-10 since ptx has been found to be able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines 33 and favor th2 response 34 it may indirectly interfere with the induction of inos it has been shown that pde inhibitors elevate camp prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses 35 and suppress proliferation of lymphocytes 36 our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that ptx treatment prevented lymphocyte proliferation in summary results of the present work demonstrated that the suppressive effect of the ptx treatment on t1d was accompanied by

            "Article: anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson disease pd more so than overall cognitive status motor deficits apathy and depression 13 although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd yet our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices remains meager and lags far behind that of depression overall neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance for example higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini mental state exam mmse as well as tests of memory and executive functions e.g attention 1014 likewise apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction 10 1523 however few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd one study showed strong negative relationship between anxiety both state and trait and overall cognitive performance measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index within sample of 27 pd patients furthermore trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans i.e immediate memory visuospatial construction language attention and delayed memory two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left sided dominant pd lpd versus right sided dominant pd rpd however their findings were inconsistent the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety whereas the second study reported that in lpd apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks e.g tmt wms iii spatial span while in rpd anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks e.g clock reading test and boston naming test furthermore anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions taken together it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning it is also striking that to date no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory 26 27 we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety furthermore since previous work albeit limited has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition we also explored this relationship seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study see table the cross sectional data from these participants was taken from patient database that has been compiled over the past years since 2008 at the parkinson disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre university of sydney inclusion criteria involved diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson disease society brain bank criteria and were confirmed by neurologist sjgl patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed full neuropsychological assessment ten patients in this study pd with anxiety pd without anxiety were taking psychotropic drugs i.e benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders such as anxiety or if they reported score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale hads thus all participants who scored within depressed hads range were excluded from this study in attempt to examine refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney and written informed consent was obtained from all participants self reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd cut off score of on the anxiety subscale of the hads hads was used to identify pd cases with anxiety pda+ while cut off score of on the hads was used to identify pd cases without anxiety pda this criterion was more stringent than usual cut off score in effort to create distinct patient groups the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr stages and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson disease rating scale updrs in similar way this was determined by calculating total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 voluntary movement items 3643 and tremor items 5057 from the mds updrs part iii see table processing speed was assessed using the trail making test part tmt score attentional set shifting was measured using the trail making test part tmt score

whitney test depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions chi square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups all analyses employed an alpha level of 0.05 and were two tailed spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions as expected the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads 0 0.001 and higher total score on the hads p 0.001 compared to the pda group table groups were matched in age 48 1.31 0.20

neither semantic verbal fluency 47 0.70 0.49 nor phonemic verbal fluency 47 0.39 0.70 differed between groups logical memory immediate recall test 176 0.059 showed trend that the pda+ group had worse

were also no differences between groups in global cognition mmse 222.5 0.23 participants were split into lpd and rpd and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda importantly the groups remained matched in age disease duration updrs iii dde stage and depression but remained significantly different on self reported anxiety lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit

retention 75.5 0.39 compared to rpda this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set shifting and working memory in pd more specifically we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part which assessed attentional set shifting on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention and to lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety taken together these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in similar way as seen in young healthy adults 26 27 although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early premotor stages of pd related degeneration 37 38 such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei i.e raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus resp which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions over time chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries 39 40 which play key role in memory and attention recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls therefore chronic stress from anxiety for example may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients however losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd while noradrenaline reuptake blocker atomoxetine has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd 45 46 overall very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits for example lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology thus cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere e.g verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd however this remains controversial it has also been suggested that since anxiety is common feature of left hemisphere involvement 48 49 cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety although these results align with previous research interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd 30 50 in addition our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings based on these limitations our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd additionally the current study employed very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain future studies are encouraged to collect more complex and comprehensive battery from larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants e.g using dsm criteria rather than relying on self reported measures to group participants in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder e.g social anxiety phobias panic disorders and generalized anxiety influences cognitive performance differently in pd one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression although there was trend that the pda+ group self reported higher levels of depression than the pda group all participants included in the study scored on the depression subscale of the hads controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as key shortcoming in the majority of recent work considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd anxiety is key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options moreover anxiety has been suggested to play key role in freezing of gait fog which is also related to attentional set shifting 52 53 future research should examine the link between anxiety set shifting and fog in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be potential therapy for improving fog.\n",
            "Abstract: research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson disease pd has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly 50% of patients and its negative impact on quality of life previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients however to date no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety 17 pda+ 33 pda who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains simple attention visuomotor processing speed executive function e.g set shifting working memory language and memory new verbal learning results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part of the trail making task tmt compared to the pda group there were no group differences in verbal fluency logical memory or tmt performance in conclusion anxiety in pd has measurable impact on working memory and attentional set shifting.\n",

            "Article: small non coding rnas are transcribed into mrna but remain untranslated in eukaryotic cells they include sirna small interfering rna mirna microrna pirna piwi interacting rna and snorna small nucleolar rna mirnas are class of multifunctional singled stranded small rna which are 20 nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna although over 000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species as many as 000 to 10 000 mirnas per genome have been predicted mirnas regulate broad range of biological processes including timing of development cell cycle progression stem cell self renewal differentiation cancer initiation cancer cell proliferation metastasis and apoptosis 511 cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes although the current treatment of radiation therapy chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur as small non coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis they may represent novel cancer therapy unlike mrna mirnas are transcribed but never translated some mirnas are transcribed from non coding regions between genes deriving from independent transcription unit other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome deriving from the introns of gene transcripts 13 14 mirna gene copy number gain loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array based comparative genomic hybridization the results demonstrated high frequency 72.8% of gene copy number abnormality in mirna containing regions in human breast cancer wang et al collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non tumor tissues mir-21 mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls whereas mir-126 mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples our studies of the mir-17 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node positive compared with node negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via heterotypic signaling although the tendency for global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested general tumor suppressor function of mirnas subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation apoptosis cancer stem cell expansion and tumorigenesis mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type culture conditions target genes and pathway the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently 21 22 le et al described the

regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation fig 1mirna regulation of

regulate the g1-s transition mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in 50% of breast cancer the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition 23 24 in addition cyclin d1 is critical downstream target of erbb2 ras and -catenin induced breast cancers and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 mir-15/16 mir-23 and let-7 mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation 18 26 the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 92 as well as mir-15/16 was confirmed by deshpande et al the let-7 family functions as tumor suppressor in variety of cancers including lung colon ovarian and breast cancer schultz et al demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor nrf-1 to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis 32 33 furthermore cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle cell growth and epithelial to mesenchymal transition emt in breast cancer mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance facilitating g1-s phase transition thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation 36 37 moreover mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal like breast cancers the breast cancer basal like subtype specific mirnas mir-221 and mir-222 promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance the onco mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in wide variety of cancers including breast cancer 40 41 mir-21 induced cellular proliferation migration invasion emt cancer stem cell characteristics and chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer 42 43 high mir-21 level is associated with poor prognosis advanced stage positive lymph node status and reduced survival time in breast cancer mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death pdcd4 in colon cancer mir-21 participates in dna damage induced g2-m checkpoint through suppressing the cell cycle regulator cdc25a recent report demonstrated the mir-21 regulates the cell cycle through targeting cdc25a in mcf-7 breast cancer cells with potential anti cancer chemical 3-diindolylmethane treatment mir-27a expression is upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines in mda mb-231 cells mir-27a negatively regulated the zinc finger zbtb10 gene and myt-1 thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation mir-27a suppressed myt-1 increased cdc2/cyclin activity and promoted the g2-m checkpoint in mda mb-231 cells thus distinct mirnas affect key genetic targets that govern distinct cell cycle checkpoints including cyclins cdks cdk inhibitors and the g2-m regulation apparatus in addition to cell cycle control breast tumor onset and progression and breast tumor stem cells are also regulated by distinct mirnas cancer stem cells cscs are characterized by their self renewal capacity an ability to differentiate into non tumorigenic cell progeny and their ability to seed tumors when transplanted into animal hosts cell surface markers such as cd44 cd24 cd133 epithelial specific antigen and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 are frequently used to isolate and enrich cscs the involvement of mirnas in regulating tumor formation by cscs or tumor initiating cells ic has been widely investigated let-7 expression is very low to undetectable level in embryonic stem cells es cells and increases with differentiation comparison of mirna expression between breast ic and non ic demonstrated reduced let-7 expression in ic and increased abundance with differentiation transduction of breast cscs with let-7 reduced the proportion of undifferentiated cells inhibited cell proliferation mammosphere formation and tumor formation in vivo clarke and colleagues identified 37 mirnas which were differentially expressed between human breast cscs cd44cd24lineage and lineage nontumorigenic breast cancer cells the mir-200 family members were downregulated in human breast cscs and normal mammary stem progenitor cells expression of mir-200 inhibited breast cancer stem cell expansion in vitro and suppressed the tumor formation ability of human breast cancer stem cell in vivo ectopic mir-34c expression reduced breast ics self renewal inhibited emt and suppressed tumor cell invasiveness via silencing notch4 zhu et al found the reduced mir-128 expression in human breast ic was accompanied by bmi-1 and abcc5 overexpression and associated with chemotherapeutic resistance and poor survival enforced mir-128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin induced apoptosis and dna damage emerging evidence has demonstrated the importance of cscs in cancer initiation cancer metastasis and drug resistance cscs are believed to be one of the most promising targets for cure of cancer the discovery that non coding rnas regulate cscs widens our understanding of cscs and may provide potential novel strategies for breast cancer therapy deletion of chromosome 6q including region 6q14-q16 is frequently observed in breast cancer the small non coding snorna u50 is candidate tumor suppressor gene in the 6q14 16 region playing role in the development and/or progression of breast cancer genomic deletion and transcriptional downregulation of snorna u50 was detected in breast cancer cell lines re expression of snorna u50 inhibited colony formation of the human breast cancer cells hs578 and mda mb-231 pirnas are small non coding rna that form rna protein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins pirna was initially discovered in germ line cells and considered as germ line specific small rnas emerging evidence indicates that pirna expression occurs in somatic cells 57 58 and piwil2 expression has been identified in human breast cancer cells high throughput deep sequencing identified group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines the study of these non coding small rnas in human cancer is just starting the identification of the expression signature of these non coding small rnas in breast cancer subtypes and an understanding of their functional significance to oncogene expression tumor initiation and tumor cell metastasis may shed important new perspectives on the role of these non coding small rnas in breast cancer small non coding rna based diagnostic and therapeutic applications for human cancer are expected in the near future although tumor targeted delivery and local administration are still major challenges to the practical application of gene therapy for cancer mirna based cancer therapeutic approaches are being established and tested in animal models synthetic mirna mimics or mirna expression vectors have been successfully applied to restore or overexpress mirna in vitro chemically modified lna anti sense mirna inhibitor and other approaches have been used to block mirna function in cells kim et al recently reported significant anti tumor effect of virus mediated delivery of mir-145 combined with 5-fu to treat breast cancer intranasal delivery of let-7 and intravenous delivery of mir-34a mimics for non small cell lung cancer treatment and virus mediated delivery of mir-26a for liver cancer treatment in mouse model demonstrate the promise of mirna for treatment of cancer dysregulated expression of mirnas has implicated components of the non coding genome as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors of breast cancer experimental evidence has shown specific mirnas regulating the initiation progression metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer via control of the cell cycle altering cellular proliferation altering cellular apoptosis and/or controlling the population of tumor stem cells dysregulated mirna expression has also been observed in cancer associated fibroblasts caf and in the systemic circulation 65 66 the circulating mirnas have the potential to serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer specific subset of dysregulated mirnas in breast cancer cells may serve as targets for gene therapy either alone or as an adjuvant treatment to current clinical protocols for breast cancer patients.\n",

2005 mathur et al 2000 early ohss is caused by the administration of exogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin hcg and it starts before the 10th day after oocyte retrieval while the late form is the result of endogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin release in the event of pregnancy and it starts after the 10th day following oocyte aspiration papanikolaou et al 2005 such strategies included the

rehydrated with intravenous crystalloid solutions 0.9% normal saline care was taken to give the patient the same amount of fluid as the amount that was drained from the peritoneal cavity all pigtail catheter placements were performed in the operating room at our surgical centre the catheter french 2.0 mm boston scientific quincy ma usa was introduced utilizing non disposable metal gamete intra fallopian treatment gift trocar and cannula embryon gift catheter ivf online gilford ct usa which was introduced into the largest accessible ascitic fluid pocket in the upper outer quadrant of the abdominal wall under local anaesthesia and trans abdominal ultrasound guidance the trocar was then removed and glide wire boston scientific corp watertown ma usa was threaded through the gift canula the canula was removed with care so as to keep the glide wire in the peritoneal cavity the pigtail catheter was guided into the peritoneal cavity by the wire after removal of the stylet of the pigtail catheter the catheter was anchored to the skin using silk suture and it was supported by gauze which was covered by tegaderm the catheter was connected to three way stop cock which was connected to drainage bag initial amount of drained fluid was calculated and subsequently the patients were trained to drain 1000 cc per day 500 cc in the morning and 500 cc in the evening one liter normal saline and 500 cc of 6% hydroxyethyle starch solution hespan was administered to the patient on the same day of pigtail catheter placement any patient with critical ohss according to the golan classification or those in whom the presenting symptoms and signs did not completely subside after drainage of ascitic fluid and iv fluid replacement were admitted to the hospital for observation and further management all other patients were sent home once there was minimal or no drainage from the catheter the patient returned to the office for removal of the catheter the patients were encouraged to drink plenty of fluids and to increase their protein intake all patients kept diary for body weight abdominal girth and urine output before and after the procedure patients were seen in the office as needed for evaluation and hydration with normal saline demographic data including mean age years duration of infertility years bmi kg m2 and aetiology of infertility are illustrated in table ovarian

outpatient basis without any complications four patients 12% required hospital admission for days 2.7 three for associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis these three patients were admitted to the hospital immediately after insertion of the pigtail catheter for management of severe pleural effusion and careful observation one patient was admitted 48 hours after insertion of the pigtail catheter for work up for chest pain all tests were negative navot et al 1992 rizk and aboulghar 1999 but perhaps the most accepted classification of ohss is the one described by golan et al as mild moderate and severe golan et al 1989 however clinicians should be aware that ohss is dynamic condition and moderate ohss may progress to severe ohss within hours rizk and aboulghar 1999 rizk 2009 therefore the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine asrm proposed classification for ohss of mild worsening and serious the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine 2008 recognizing the patients at high risk prevention and early recognition are the most important steps in the management of ohss rizk 2006 however severe forms of ohss especially late onset type that occurs when patients are pregnant most likely will continue to happen albeit at much lower rate unless one reverts to total freeze of all embryos after the use of gnrh agonist as trigger shot in gnrh antagonist cycle donoso and devroey 2013 devroey et al 2011 traditional treatment consists mainly of supportive management until spontaneous resolution occurs rizk 1994 although moderate ohss does not usually require intervention outpatient monitoring is essential to identify progression to severe form rizk 2006 patients with moderate ohss can be managed on an outpatient basis by adequate hydration and close daily monitoring of weight gain and abdominal girth to detect progression to severe ohss and to provide intervention if required rizk 2010 patients presenting with severe forms of ohss are usually managed on inpatient basis and most patients with critical ohss are admitted to intensive care units for aggressive supportive measures to avoid maternal morbidity and mortality the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine 2008 correction of hypovolemia electrolyte imbalance and hypoalbuminemia are the basic principles during the treatment of severe ohss rizk 1994 2006 myrianthefs et al 2000 1992 suggested that paracentesis is the single most important treatment modality in life threatening ohss not controlled by medical therapy paracentesis and removal of ascites result in relieving the pressure on the inferior vena cava and improvement in venous return cardiac output and renal perfusion padilla et al 1990 therefore prompt drainage of fluid produces significant clinical and biochemical improvement including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process abuzeid et al 2003 the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine 2008 it is also possible that removal of ascites decreases the amount of vegf and its effects on vascular permeability therefore ultrasound guided drainage of the ascitic fluid should be performed in severe cases of ohss with respiratory distress oliguria or severe abdominal pain padilla et al 1990 this can be done either trans vaginally aboulghar et al 1990 or trans abdominally padilla et al 1990 however recurrence of ascites is common in severe cases of ohss placement of pigtail catheter has been proposed by some investigators to allow drainage of ascitic fluid whenever it accumulates without the need for further surgical procedures abuzeid et al 2003 in previous study we reported the use of percutaneous pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites in severe ohss as an alternative to repeated paracentesis abuzeid et al 2003 this procedure is relatively simple and requires short period of time as compared to the time needed to gradually aspirate any fluid accumulation transvaginally immediate relief of symptoms and signs of severe ohss after pigtail catheter insertion was an important finding in addition the ease by which any accumulated ascitic fluid was drained resulted in faster resolution of ohss abuzeid et al no infection was reported abuzeid et al 2003 in that study the first 13 patients they were discharged home with the pigtail catheter in place and managed on an outpatient basis until ohss subsided thereafter the catheter was removed the last 13 patients were managed on an outpatient basis without any problem abuzeid mi et al 2003 our previous study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the pigtail catheter for the management of severe ohss therefore we embarked on the current study to evaluate the role of pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with severe ohss syndrome in the current study we demonstrated that patients who were diagnosed very early with severe ohss can be managed safely and effectively on outpatient basis using pigtail catheter drainage iv fluid replacement and careful monitoring although all 33 patients presented with shortness of breath marked abdominal distension nausea weight gain and lower abdominal pain and 13 of them complained of vomiting all are criteria for hospital admission according to the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine on ohss 30 patients were sent home as their presenting symptoms were relieved early diagnosis and intervention resulted in rapid elimination of the symptoms of severe ohss and normalization of vital signs which allow us to manage the patients on outpatient basis the pigtail catheter placements were performed without complications and patients were discharged home after few hours of observation the patients who needed hospital admission were those with associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis another patient was admitted to the hospital for day for work up for chest pain and possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism once pulmonary embolism was ruled out she was discharged home with pigtail catheter in place and she was managed on outpatient basis outpatient management of ohss has no place in those who fail to have complete resolutions of their symptoms or those with severe hyperproteinuria or electrolyte imbalance certainly it has no place in patients with critical ohss such as those with severe pleural effusion diminished urine output severe hemoconcentration and those at increased risk of thromboembolic risks rizk 2010 it is imperative to stress that such protocol can only be used in patients who are motivated reliable and have the necessary support at home to allow them to return to the clinic or go to the emergency room if the need arises it also requires dedicated in vitro fertilization nurses to educate and follow up the patient on daily basis contrary to other reports that state that access to intravenous albumin is critical part of outpatient management for severe ohss we did not use any albumin replacement lincoln et al 2002 the reason behind the use of intravenous albumin is to increase intravascular oncotic pressure thereby curtailing the exodus of free water from the intravascular space in our study we used hespan instead of albumin as some investigators have shown that it is beneficial in reducing the incidence of severe ohss youssef et al 2011 by increasing the intravascular oncotic pressure in addition the majority of our patients had late onset ohss as result of pregnancy hespan should be used with caution in patients with late onset ohss only when benefits outweigh risks.it is fact that outpatient management of early severe ohss is common practice among infertility specialists after trans vaginal aspiration of ascitic fluid and iv fluid hydration outpatient management by repeated abdominal or trans vaginal paracentesis has been reported to be safe effective and cost effective lincoln et al 2002 shrivastav et al 1994 fluker et al 2000 1994 were the first to suggest that day care management in patients with severe ohss with abdominal paracentesis and iv hydration was simple safe and effective compared with traditional treatment with in patient hospitalization and supportive measures 2002 concluded that the need for hospitalization for hyperstimulated patients can be minimized by outpatient management of severe ohss with trans vaginal culdocentesis and rehydration with crystalloids and albumin 2000 advocated in pilot study an active management strategy for moderate ohss which involved early paracentesis designed to minimize the progression from moderate to severe ohss instead of late paracentesis aimed at speeding up recovery in severely ill patients 2010 concluded that early outpatient paracentesis for moderate to severe ohss is the most cost effective management plan when compared with traditional conservative inpatient therapy 2009 reported large series of patients with severe ohss in whom the vast majority were successfully managed as outpatients with use of aggressive trans vaginal paracentesis smith et al 2009 despite the findings in our study it is important to emphasize that ohss remains serious disorder with the potential for rapid deterioration requiring hospitalization and intensive treatment of critically ill patient the life threatening complications of ohss are secondary to thromboembolism or compromised pulmonary or cardiovascular function and multi organ failure there have been isolated reports of women dying from the complications associated with ohss the mortality rate related to ohss is very low and was estimated by brinsden et al more recently reports regarding maternal mortality rates due to ohss in the netherlands and united kingdom demonstrate an incidence of approximately deaths per 100 000 in ivf cycles braat et al 2006 lewis 2007 eleven lethal complications of assisted reproductive technology have been documented and summarized by braat et al several investigators reported sporadic fatality as result of ohss due to adult respiratory distress syndrome massive pulmonary oedema myocardial infarction and carotid artery occlusion resulting in cerebral infarction in this study we describe modified technique of what interventional radiologists usually use for pigtail catheter placement we observed that in the obese patients the metal introducer provided in the pigtail catheter kit is difficult to use instead we used the non disposable gamete intra fallopian treatment trocar and cannula to facilitate the introduction of the catheter through the abdominal wall of such patients this technique helps to manage the patients in the office without the need for sending her to the hospital for an interventional radiologist to place the catheter however the patients in this study were identified from our in vitro fertilization database the study included every patient who developed severe critical ohss in addition the lack of control group that was managed without pigtail catheter placement limits the conclusions that can be drawn from our study in summary drainage of ascitic fluid in patients with severe critical ohss is an important step in the management of this condition rizk 2010 the placement of pigtail catheter resulted in safe and effective outpatient management of the majority of patients with severe ohss however outpatient management of this potentially fatal condition requires clear understanding that rapid deterioration may occur which may necessitate hospitalization and intensive treatment of critically ill patient rizk 2006 2010 patients with critical ohss and those with persistence of symptoms of severe ohss despite insertion of pigtail catheter and drainage of ascitic fluid should be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management.\n",

of islet -cells in type diabetes is mediated by the immune cells particularly autoreactive cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes cells macrophages and dendritic cells in order to obtain insight into type diabetes pathogenic mechanisms in humans and to test novel therapeutic approaches for its treatment different preclinical models of the disease such as spontaneous and accelerated diabetes in the non obese diabetic nod mice biobreeding rats or diabetes induced in susceptible rodent strains by multiple low doses of streptozotocin mlds are now available in the pathogenesis of t1d several proinflamma tory cytokines including ifn tnf il-1 as well as il-17 have been implicated it is also thought that the production of anti inflammatory cytokines such as il-4 il-10 and tgf correlates with protection from t1d it has been shown that some drugs such as pentoxifylline ptx have immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory activity which might represent potential preventive therapy for autoimmune diseases ptx is methyl xanthine derived general phosphodiesterase pde inhibitor that has been available for many years to treat vascular disorder phosphodiesterases pdes are family of enzymes that regulate intracellular levels of the cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp and cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp by catalyzing their breakdown to inactive metabolites drugs that increase the levels of camp tend to reduce the production of proinflammatory mediators and increase the production of anti inflammatory mediators by immune cells in recent years the potential of ptx as an immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory agent gained interest as it has been shown to effectively suppress the synthesis of tnf and other pro inflammatory cytokines such as ifn and il-12 in vitro and in vivo 10 ptx has been successfully used for the treatment of experimental autoimmune diseases including experimental autoimmune myocarditis eam 11 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 12 and

commonly used animal model that has many histological and clinical features similar to those of human type diabetes and involves the participation of macrophages and cells streptozotocin stz is pancreatic cell toxin that induces inflammation of the islets by immune cells when it is given in multiple low doses 16 this model of diabetes offers some advantages such as simultaneous appearance of diabetes mellitus in all animals and not having immune abnormalities that may complicate studies in spontaneous diabetes in non obese diabetic nod mice or bio breeding bb rats therefore this model as good model has been applied extensively to investigate the type diabetes mellitus especially study the immune pathways and modulations of autoimmune insulitis and cell death 17 18 c57bl/6 mice also called c57 black or simply black has the advantage of strain stability and easy breeding the most common application of c57bl/6 mice is to serve as physiological or pathological models for in vivo experiments 19 as such mlds induced c57bl/6j mice were chosen to evaluate the anti hyperglycemic activity of ptx and investigate the immunotherapeutic molecular mechanisms of how ptx attenuated the development of t1d ptx is commonly used for the treatment of microcirculatory disorders and yields only minimal side effects in patients in addition due to its varied immunomodulatory effects ptx has been used in several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis 20 multiple sclerosis 21 and systemic lupus erythematosus 22 drugs that increase the level of camp including pde inhibitors are known to prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses 20 previous studies have also shown that ptx lowers blood glucose levels in diabetic animals 23 and the results from the present studies also indicated that ptx possessed an anti hyperglycemic property more importantly the present data demonstrated that ptx could increase serum insulin concentrations in type diabetic mice it has been shown that ptx could reduce but not abrogate the insulin requirements or lengthen the honeymoon non insulin requiring period in study of 21 children with new onset type 1diabetes 24 helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines tnf ifn il-1 il-6 and il-12 which activate macrophages and cytotoxic cells to destroy -cells whereas anti inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 that are produced by activated helper cells prevent -cell destructive insulitis 25 il-10 has been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in mice 26 in response to cytokine stimulation -cells generate reactive oxygen species ross and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide no which facilitate their destruction 27 no is also synthesized within cytokine activated macrophages by inducible nitric oxide synthase inos 28 more recently the role of il-17-producing cells have been demonstrated in the development of several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and type diabetes il-17 is proinflammatory cytokine that is detrimental to pancreatic islet cells 29 il-17 promotes infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages stimulates the production of other proinflammatory cytokines including tnf il-1 il-6 and il-12 by activated macrophages and induces nitric oxide release from cells that interferes with their function and cause -cell destruction 30 it has been assumed that ptx similar to camp elevating agents selectively suppresses the production of helper type il-2 ifn but not helper type il-4 il-6 il-10 cytokines 31 however it has also been demonstrated that the effect of ptx on cytokine production is cell specific 32 the present study shows that ptx is not only able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines ifn and il-17 but can also increase the production of anti inflammatory cytokines il-10 since ptx has been found to be able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines 33 and favor th2 response 34 it may indirectly interfere with the induction of inos it has been shown that pde inhibitors elevate camp prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses 35 and suppress proliferation of lymphocytes 36 our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that ptx treatment prevented lymphocyte proliferation in summary results of the present work demonstrated that the suppressive effect of the ptx treatment on t1d was accompanied by decreased blood glucose level increased plasma insulin level suppression of cell proliferation down regulation of th1 and th17 cytokines ifn and il-17 and increase in the production of il-10 in supernatant of splenic culture of the treated mice it seems that pentoxifylline treatment has therapeutic effect against mlds induced diabetes in mice.\n",
            "Abstract: objective :pentoxifylline is an immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory agent and is used in vascular disorders it has been shown that pentoxifylline inhibits proinflammatory cytokines production the purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of pentoxifylline on the treatment of autoimmune diabetes in mice.materials and methods diabetes was induced by multiple low dose of streptozotocin mlds injection 40 mg kg day for consecutive days in male c57bl/6 mice after induction of diabetes mice were treated with pentoxifylline 100 mg kg day ip for 21 days blood glucose levels and plasma levels of insulin were measured splenocytes were tested for proliferation by mtt test and cytokine production by elisa.results:pentoxifylline treatment prevented hyperglycemia and increased plasma insulin levels in the diabetic mice aside from reducing lymphocyte proliferation pentoxifylline significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory interleukin 17 il-17 as well as interferon gamma ifn while increased anti inflammatory cytokine il-10 as compared with those in mlds group diabetic control group.conclusion these findings indicate that pentoxifylline may have therapeutic effect against the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells during the development of mlds induced type diabetes in mice.\n",

              "{'article': 'anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson disease pd more so than overall cognitive status motor deficits apathy and depression 13 although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd yet our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices remains meager and lags far behind that of depression overall neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance for example higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini mental state exam mmse as well as tests of memory and executive functions e.g attention 1014 likewise apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction 10 1523 however few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd one study showed strong negative relationship between anxiety both state and trait and overall cognitive performance measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index within sample of 27 pd patients furthermore trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans i.e immediate memory visuospatial construction language attention and delayed memory two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left sided dominant pd lpd versus right sided dominant pd rpd however their findings were inconsistent the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety whereas the second study reported that in lpd apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks e.g tmt wms iii spatial span while in rpd anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks e.g clock reading test and boston naming test furthermore anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions taken together it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning it is also striking that to date no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory 26 27 we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety furthermore since previous work albeit limited has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition we also explored this relationship seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study see table the cross sectional data from these participants was taken from patient database that has been compiled over the past years since 2008 at the parkinson disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre university of sydney inclusion criteria involved diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson disease society brain bank criteria and were confirmed by neurologist sjgl patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed full neuropsychological assessment ten patients in this study pd with anxiety pd without anxiety were taking psychotropic drugs i.e benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders such as anxiety or if they reported score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale hads thus all participants who scored within depressed hads range were excluded from this study in attempt to examine refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney and written informed consent was obtained from all participants self reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd cut off score of on the anxiety subscale of the hads hads was used to identify pd cases with anxiety pda+ while cut off score of on the hads was used to identify pd cases without anxiety pda this criterion was more stringent than usual cut off score in effort to create distinct patient groups the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr stages and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson disease rating scale updrs in similar way this was determined by calculating total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 voluntary movement items 3643 and tremor items 5057 from the mds updrs part iii see table processing speed was assessed using the trail making test part tmt score attentional set shifting was measured using the trail making test part tmt score working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale iii raw scores language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test cowat animals and letters score the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale iii lm score lm ii score lm retention score the mini mental state examination mmse demographic clinical and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent test or mann whitney test depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions chi square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups all analyses employed an alpha level of 0.05 and were two tailed spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions as expected the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads 0 0.001 and higher total score on the hads p 0.001 compared to the pda group table groups were matched in age 48 1.31 0.20 disease duration 259 0.66 updrs iii score 250.5 0.65 = 245 0.43 ledd 159.5 0.80 and depression hads 190.5 0.06 additionally all groups were matched in the distribution of gender 0.098 0.75 and side affected 0.765 0.38 there were no group differences for tmt performance 256 0.62 table however the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part 46 2.03 0.048 compared to the pda group figure the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest 48 2.22 0.031 and backward subtest 190.5 0.016 compared to the pda group figures and neither semantic verbal fluency 47 0.70 0.49 nor phonemic verbal fluency 47 0.39 0.70 differed between groups logical memory immediate recall test 176 0.059 showed trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group however logical memory ii test performance 219 0.204 and logical memory retention 242.5 0.434 did not differ between groups there were also no differences between groups in global cognition mmse 222.5 0.23 participants were split into lpd and rpd and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda importantly the groups remained matched in age disease duration updrs iii dde stage and depression but remained significantly different on self reported anxiety lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test 19 2.29 0.033 compared to lpda whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test 36.5 0.006 lm immediate recall 37.5 0.008 and lm ii 45.0 0.021 but not lm retention 75.5 0.39 compared to rpda this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set shifting and working memory in pd more specifically we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part which assessed attentional set shifting on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention and to lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety taken together these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in similar way as seen in young healthy adults 26 27 although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early premotor stages of pd related degeneration 37 38 such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei i.e raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus resp which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions over time chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries 39 40 which play key role in memory and attention recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls therefore chronic stress from anxiety for example may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients however losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd while noradrenaline reuptake blocker atomoxetine has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd 45 46 overall very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits for example lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology thus cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere e.g verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd however this remains controversial it has also been suggested that since anxiety is common feature of left hemisphere involvement 48 49 cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety although these results align with previous research interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd 30 50 in addition our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings based on these limitations our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd additionally the current study employed very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain future studies are encouraged to collect more complex and comprehensive battery from larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants e.g using dsm criteria rather than relying on self reported measures to group participants in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder e.g social anxiety phobias panic disorders and generalized anxiety influences cognitive performance differently in pd one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression although there was trend that the pda+ group self reported higher levels of depression than the pda group all participants included in the study scored on the depression subscale of the hads controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as key shortcoming in the majority of recent work considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd anxiety is key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options moreover anxiety has been suggested to play key role in freezing of gait fog which is also related to attentional set shifting 52 53 future research should examine the link between anxiety set shifting and fog in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be potential therapy for improving fog.',\n",

offs were - two standard deviations ( sd ) from the mean . \\n each student that was malnourished and poor has been taken into account for free food and nutritious snacks . \\n demographic information , height , weight and knowledge of the students were measured by use of a validated and reliable ( cronbach 's alpha was 0.61 ) questionnaire . \\n this project is granted by shiraz university of medical sciences , charities and welfare organization and education organization of fars province . \\n statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) software , version 17.0 ( spss inc . , chicago , il , usa ) . \\n the results are expressed as mean  sd and proportions as appropriated . in order to determine the effective variables on the malnutrition status \\n paired t test was used to compare the end values with baseline ones in each group . \\n two - sided p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant . in this project , \\n the who z - score cut - offs used were as follow : using bmi - for - age z - scores ; overweight : > + 1 sd , i.e. , z - score > 1 ( equivalent to bmi 25 kg / m ) , obesity : > + 2 sd ( equivalent to bmi 30 \\n kg / m ) , thinness : < 2 sd and severe thinness : < 3 sd . \\n study population contains 2897 children ; 70.8% were primary school students and 29.2% were secondary school students . \\n 2336 ( 80.5% ) out of total students were well - off and 561 children ( 19.5% ) were indigent . \\n 19.5% of subjects were in case group ( n = 561 ) and 80.5% were in the control group ( n = 2336 ) . \\n the mean of age in welfare group was 10.0  2.3 and 10.5  2.5 in non - welfare group . \\n demographic characteristics of school aged children in shiraz , iran table 2 shows the frequency of subjects in different categories of bmi for age in non - welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately among boys and girls before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model in shiraz , iran . \\n the frequency of subjects with bmi lower than < 2 sd decreased significantly after intervention among non - welfare girls ( p < 0.01 ) . \\n however , there were no significant decreases in the frequency of subjects with bmi lower than < 2 sd boys . \\n when we assess the effect of intervention in total population without separating by sex groups , we found no significant change in this population [ table 3 ] . \\n bmi for age for iranian students aged 7 - 14 years based on gender according to who growth standards 2007 bmi for age for iranian students aged 7 - 14 years according to who growth standards 2007 in non - welfare and welfare groups of total population table 4 has shown the prevalence of normal bmi , mild , moderate and severe malnutrition in non - welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately among boys and girls before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model . according to this table \\n there were no significant differences in the prevalence of mild , moderate and severe malnutrition among girls and boys . \\n table 4 also shows the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys . \\n the pre- and post - test education assessment in both groups showed that the student 's average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5  3.2 to 16.8  4.3 ( p < 0.0001 ) . \\n bmi , height and weight in non - welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately in males and females before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model in shiraz , iran according to study 's finding the odds ratio ( or ) of sever thinness and thinness in non - welfare compared with welfare is 3.5 ( or = 3.5 , confidence interval [ ci ] = 2.5 - 3.9 , p < 0.001 ) . \\n furthermore , the finding showed or of overweight and obesity in welfare compared to non - welfare is 19.3 ( or = 19.3 , ci = 2.5 - 3.9 , p = 0.04 ) . \\n the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . \\n this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio - economic level . according to our knowledge , \\n this is the first study , which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city ( shiraz ) in iran . \\n the other program in iran ( nffp ) is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities . \\n allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government , selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools , paying attention of policy makers to student 's nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . however , negligence of under - poverty line , providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . \\n advocacy by definition is a blending of science , ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues . by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity \\n angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions . in the present study \\n another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues . \\n it seems that in iran , free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas , but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz . at baseline , \\n no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre- and post - nutritional status intervention . \\n in contrast , the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% , which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students . \\n there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age ( 2 to + 1 sd ) most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males . \\n this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population . in the age range of the present study female \\n although , there is no nffp in big cities of iran , there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools . \\n a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . \\n the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children , psychological test 's scores and the grade - point average following this school feeding program . \\n the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . \\n there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran , which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . \\n hence , nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge , which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs . a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns , in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children . in advocacy program audience 's analysis \\n accordingly , one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent - teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences \\n . we also took into account policy makers in different levels , from national to local as primary audiences . \\n advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools . \\n providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories , but their benefits should be warranted . \\n another choice was community involvement ; which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . \\n advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student 's snacks based on the new definition . however , there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program . \\n mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges . \\n moreover , providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter - sector collaboration . \\n although in a limited number of schools , in our study , interventions and advocacy program was successful , expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . in this \\n regard , advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp . \\n the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight , obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . \\n assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population . as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject 's dietary adherence . \\n furthermore , this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day . \\n the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio - cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas . \\n regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children , provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio - economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe . \\n community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children .\", 'it occurs in more than 50% of patients and may reach 90% in certain types of cancers , especially in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.1 anemia is defined as an inadequate circulating level of hemoglobin ( hb ) ( hb < 12 g / dl ) and may arise as a result of the underlying disease , bleeding , poor nutrition , chemotherapy , or radiation therapy . \\n preliminary studies suggest that survival and loco - regional control after radiation therapy , especially in head and neck cancers , may be compromised by anemia.24 anemia often worsens symptoms such as fatigue , weakness , and dyspnea , and thus may have a negative effect on quality of life ( qol ) and performance status in patients with cancer . \\n thus , to improve physical functioning , qol , and prognosis in patients with cancer , it would be reasonable to take a proactive approach in identifying populations who need treatment for cancer - associated anemia ( caa ) and provide timely management . \\n blood transfusion is an effective way to replace depleted hb within a short period , but the effect is , unfortunately , temporary and can cause serious adverse risks and increased mortality . in randomized clinical trials in patients with caa \\n , erythropoiesis - stimulating agents ( esas ) produced significant increases in hb level , decreased transfusion requirements , and improved qol.57 however , 30%50% of patients do not respond to such agents . \\n in addition , the use of esas often causes concern about severe adverse reactions.6,8 in several studies , esas were found to shorten overall survival time , or time to tumor progression in patients whose hb level reached more than 12 g / dl . \\n these studies included patients with different primary cancers , such as breast , lung , head and neck , cervix , and lymphomas.911 the lack of response to erythropoietin stimulation in patients with cancer is partly attributed to the functional iron deficiency state , in which the high rate of erythropoiesis exceeds the delivery of usable iron , despite adequate iron stores.12 absolute iron deficiency , in contrast , occurs when iron delivery is impaired because iron stores are depleted ( serum ferritin , < 100 ng / ml ; transferring saturation , < 20%).13 hepcidin , a peptide hormone produced by the liver , is up - regulated in chronic inflammatory states including cancer . \\n hepcidin inhibits iron transport across cell membranes , thus decreasing the accessibility of stored iron and gastrointestinal absorption of dietary iron , leading to an increased frequency of iron - restricted erythropoiesis.1416 many randomized trials examined the role of intravenous ( iv ) iron in addition to esas in the treatment of anemia in patients with cancer . \\n many of these studies showed improvement in esa response , time to maximal response , reduction in esa dose , and improvement in qol parameters ( when measured ) in favor of the combination over esas alone . \\n the observed benefit was independent of baseline iron parameters.1721 one study found a 36% reduction in the number of patients transfused.21 this pilot study assessed the efficacy and feasibility of iv iron monotherapy in patients with cancer who have anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy without the use of esas . \\n patients received the study treatment for 12 weeks followed by a 4-week follow - up period . \\n eligible patients were at least 18 years old , about to start a cycle of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 1 week of inclusion , and had a nonmyeloid malignancy , hb levels of 11.0 g / dl or less , a life expectancy of more than 24 weeks , and an eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of 02 . \\n patients were also required to have a serum ferritin level of 100 ng / ml or higher or transferrin saturation ( tsat ) levels of 15% or higher and to have received no esas or iv iron therapy within 30 days and no oral iron therapy ( 27 mg / day or more ) within 7 days before enrollment . \\n patients were excluded for leukoerythroblastic features on blood film , hemolysis , gastrointestinal bleeding , folate or vitamin b12 deficiency , elevated serum ferritin ( 900 ng / ml ) or transferrin saturation ( tsat ) ( 35% ) levels , pregnancy or lactation , liver dysfunction ( grade 2 or higher based on national cancer institute common toxicity criteria ) , renal dysfunction ( serum creatinine levels 2.0 mg / dl ) , active infection requiring systemic antibiotics , personal or family history of hemochromatosis , comorbidities precluding study participation , hypersensitivity to iv iron , red blood cell transfusion within the last 2 weeks , or any investigational agent within 30 days before enrollment . \\n patients were not allowed to take any vitamin , mineral , or herbal supplements containing 27 mg or more of iron per day or 100 mg vitamin c per day during the study or follow - up period . \\n blood transfusions were permitted at the primary physician s discretion if hb levels decreased to 8 g / dl or less , and such patients were considered treatment failures . \\n written informed consent was provided by all patients before study participation , and the protocol and supporting documents were approved by the institutional review board of king hussein cancer center . \\n the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and good clinical practice as contained in the us code of federal regulations that governs the protection of human subjects and the obligations of clinical investigators . \\n patients received 200 mg ferric hydroxide sucrose diluted in 100 ml normal saline and infused over the course of 1 hour weekly for a total of 12 weeks . the first dose was given during the first clinic visit ( 4 days from the initiation of chemotherapy or radiation therapy ) . \\n tsat was monitored , as protocol mandated withholding iron therapy when tsat levels were higher than 50% . at the first clinic visit ( week 1 ; baseline ) , a blood sample was obtained for laboratory assessments before the study treatment was started . \\n patients attended weekly clinic visits for treatment and assessment ; and returned for follow -

dose ifosfamide , vincristine , vinblastine , bleomycin , and others . \\n many of the included patients had their chemotherapy treatment as second- or third - line therapy . \\n patients characteristics , including age , primary tumor , and active anticancer treatment are summarized in table 1 . \\n one patient died during the study from his tumor ( after week 2 ) , and five patients withdrew from the study because of inconvenience ( three after week 3 , and two after week 4 ) . \\n nineteen ( 76.0% ) patients completed a minimum of three treatments , 15 ( 60.0% ) completed nine treatments , and 14 ( 56.0% ) completed all twelve planned weekly treatments . \\n as seen in table 2 , the mean hb level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 g / dl ( median , 9.9 g / dl ; range , 6.9 g / dl10.9 g / dl ) . for the 15 patients who completed at least nine treatments , the mean change in their hb level was 1.7 g / dl ( median , 1.1 g / dl ; range , 1.9 g / dl to 3.2 g / dl ) . \\n for the 14 patients who completed the whole treatment period ( 12 weeks ) , the mean hb level change was 2.1 g / dl ( median , 1.3 g / dl ; range , 0.2 g / dl to 4.6 g / dl ; p = 0.0007 ) . \\n eight ( 42.1% ) of the 19 patients who completed at least three iron infusions had a more than 1 g / dl increase in their hb level . \\n hemoglobin level changes for the 14 patients who completed twelve iron infusions are shown in figure 1 . \\n no iv iron - related adverse events were reported among patients during the study or the follow - up period . \\n tsat was monitored during the study period , and no patients had tsat levels increase to more than 50% . \\n the highest ferritin level among patients who completed at least nine iv iron treatments was 1,170 ng / ml ; the mean level at the end of study period for the whole group was 379 ng / ml . \\n five ( 20.0% ) patients received blood transfusions and were considered treatment failures ( three after week 3 , transfused at hb levels of 6.9 g / dl , 7.8 g / dl , and 5.4 g / dl ; one after week 4 , transfused at an hb level of 8.2 g / dl ; and one after week 9 , transfused at an hb level of 7.2 g / dl ) . \\n low hb levels are associated with diminished qol and possibly decreased overall survival.2 successful treatment of anemia has undeniable benefits for patients , often yielding dramatic symptomatic improvement . \\n although the role of esas is well - established in treating caa , big concerns were recently raised about the negative effect of esas on survival in some patients with cancer.911 concerns about the risk for thromboembolism in patients with cancer with higher hb levels who are receiving esa were also addressed in many trials.22,23 in addition , the possible immunosuppressive effects of blood product transfusions that may have relevance to neoplasia progression were addressed before.24 , 25 in our pilot study , we tested the feasibility of using iron supplementation alone to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy without the use of esas or blood transfusion , which could be a valid alternative , especially for patients with curable cancers . \\n oral iron is easier to administer and relatively inexpensive , but low patient adherence , poor enteral absorption , and poor tolerance because of a wide range of troublesome gastrointestinal adverse effects limit its overall effectiveness.26 anemia of chronic disease may occur in patients with cancer and is associated with an increase in hepcidin levels , which decreases oral iron absorption and bone marrow iron use , negating any possible effect of regular doses of oral iron.15 iv iron therapy significantly improves response to epoetin alfa when compared with oral iron or no iron in anemic patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.1721 oral iron supplements with esas showed no significant benefit over esas alone in treating caa.21 sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose appear to have more favorable safety profiles over iron dextran . \\n a large prospective safety comparison trial failed to show serious anaphylactoid reactions,27 which is confirmed in our study , in which no patients developed reactions and no patients withdrew from the study because of adverse effects . given that the mean hb increase using esas with iv iron in one large controlled trial was 2.4 g / dl,21 the results obtained in our study are clinically significant . \\n these findings should be further confirmed and better assessed in larger studies , in which questions such as the optimal timing of iv iron therapy with respect to chemotherapy and the optimal total dose of iv iron should be determined . \\n the use of iv iron monotherapy was recently reviewed by a group in germany that studied the use of ferric carboxymaltose to replace esa and blood transfusions as a treatment for caa . \\n iron - deficient patients treated with ferric carboxymaltose alone ( n = 233 ) had a median of 1.4 g / dl increase in hemoglobin levels compared with those receiving additional treatment with esas ( n = 46 ; median , 1.6 g / dl ) . our study , \\n however , is peculiar in using iron therapy in a non - iron - deficiency state.28 iron overload after iv iron therapy , with potential concerns about the risk of developing secondary cancers and infection , might be raised . \\n the highest serum ferritin level in the present study in patients who completed at least 9 weeks of iv iron therapy was 1,170 ng / ml . most of the literature addressing cancer and infections in iron - overloaded patients comes from patients with hemochromatosis or patients who are undergoing hemodialysis . \\n published reviews report an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma only in patients with hemochromatosis after they develop cirrhosis.29 similarly data supporting the association between iv iron therapy and higher infection rate are weak and not well - supported.30 in fact , anemia itself is a risk factor for infections in patients receiving hemodialysis.31 a multivariate analysis of associations between iron and mortality in more than 58,000 patients receiving hemodialysis reported no increased death rate from serum ferritin levels as high as 1,200 ng / ml.30 the increasing cost of therapy in patients with cancer is of grave concern , which could be an additional benefit of iv iron over the use of esas in such patients . to further address many of the questions raised , \\n our team is planning a bigger trial for iv iron in patients with cancer who have anemia to confirm the results discussed in this pilot trial . \\n in addition , we will be looking into predictors of response to iv iron , such as serum hepcidin level . \\n iv iron therapy alone is safe and may be effective in improving hb levels in patients with cancer who are undergoing active anticancer therapy . \\n further randomized trials are needed to address many of the questions raised in our pilot study .', \"tardive dystonia ( td ) , a rarer side effect after longer exposure to antipsychotics , is characterized by local or general , sustained , involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle group , with twisting movements , generally slow , which may affect the limbs , trunk , neck , or face . \\n td has been shown to develop in about 3% of patients who have had long - term exposure to antipsychotics . \\n . the low risk of td for atypical antipsychotics is thought to result from their weak affinity for dopamine receptors . compared with typical , \\n atypical antipsychotic agents have a greater affinity for serotonin 5-ht2a than dopamine d2 receptors , with a low propensity to induce td . among this olanzapine \\n is thought to have preferential action at mesolimbic over nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways and is , therefore , associated with a very low incidence of extrapyramidal symptom ( eps ) . \\n furthermore , a retrospective analysis of controlled multicentric trials suggested that olanzapine also improves preexisting symptoms of tardive movements . \\n we report a case of 20-year - old male , belonging to lower socioeconomic class , educated up to 2 standard , presented with severe unilateral dystonic left sided neck movements [ figure 1 ] . \\n careful history exploration revealed he was taking risperidone 2 mg irregularly for 2 months and then olanzapine 5 mg for another 4 months . \\n picture of neck dystonia of patient at 19 years , the patient presented with occasional anger outbursts , getting provoked on small matters and beating family members , running away from home , screaming episodes occasionally , fearfulness , sleep disturbance for 2 days ; which was precipitated after fever . according to the mother \\n , one friend might have threatened / made fun of him actually and after that patient stopped going out of house , and displayed above mentioned symptoms . \\n this was interpreted as psychosis with persecutory ideas , and he was treated with risperidone 2 mg / day for 2 months and then with olanzapine 5 mg / day for 4 months . in last two follow - ups patient did not present himself , and mother reported unusual neck movements , which were taken as a part of his overall psychopathology and not taken seriously , slight intermittent neck movements reported were missed as part of adolescent behavior problems mimicking some hero in movies . as neck dystonia increased , the patient had a severe disability as patient had to keep his hands behind his head for the support . \\n the movement would decrease when the patient was lying down and was absent during sleep . \\n he even stopped taking food due to severe neck movements making chewing and swallowing difficult . \\n his birth and early developmental milestones were normal . during 210 years of age patient was inattentive and mildly hyperactive . \\n other siblings were educated with master 's degree , and patient was also sent to school , but due to inattention and restlessness , he did not pass 2 standard after three attempts . \\n he left the schooling . with average executive functioning and life skills , he worked as an unskilled laborer in the neighborhood shops as a helping hand . \\n , he was found to be getting over familiar , cheerful , moody , and short tempered . \\n sometimes , the patient had inappropriate social judgment ; for which his friends made fun of him , and teased him . on mental status assessment , \\n routine investigations , thyroid function tests , electroencephalogram , fundus examination , cervical x -

 tablet bd , and clonazepam 1 mg bd . \\n earlier case reports reported td developing with high - dose atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine 20 mg or aripiprazole 15 mg with longer duration of exposure of around 1215 months in established psychiatric illness like schizophrenia or any other psychotic illness . \\n eps in general and tardive dyskinesia , in particular , have been extensively studied in schizophrenia . even though a number of studies suggest that bipolar patients experience higher rates of eps ( parkinsonism , dystonia , akathisia ) and td compared to patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia , research within the bd population has been limited . \\n the risk is found to be 3 to 5 times higher in elderly patients compared to young patients . \\n in addition to age , the risk is directly proportional to : female gender , daily and total dose of the antipsychotic drug , presence of mood disorder , the use of anticholinergics with neuroleptics , previous physical therapies ( electroconvulsive therapy ) , the presence of other physical illness such as diabetes or an organic disorder , younger age of exposure , and the presence of extrapyramidal symptoms early in treatment . \\n this patient 's severe dystonic neck movements developed within short period of 6 months of exposure to atypical antipsychotics risperidone 2 mg and then olanzapine 5 mg only , which can cause minimal extrapyramidal side effects . in this case , \\n risk factors for developing serious disabling td were neuroleptic exposure , borderline intellectual functioning , externalizing behavior , probable misdiagnosis , and overlooking early indicators of side effects . \\n this case highlights dangers of casually prescribing low dose second generation antipsychotics in patient with hyperthymic temperament and borderline intellectual functioning with vague short lasting presenting complaints ; probably misdiagnosed as psychosis ; leading to such severe adverse effects because patients with organic brain damage are more prone to develop adverse effects like td . \\n thus , judicious use of antipsychotics , with detailed and frequent assessments is important , and emergent stereotyped behavior or unexplained movements must be examined carefully and taken seriously . \\n the authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms . in the form the patient(s ) \\n has / have given his / her / their consent for his / her / their images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal . \\n the patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity , but anonymity can not be guaranteed . \\n the authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms . in the form the patient(s ) \\n has / have given his / her / their consent for his / her / their images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal . \\n the patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity , but anonymity can not be guaranteed . \\n  \\n \", 'lepidoptera include agricultural pests that , through feeding and other activities , negatively affect stored grains , food and fiber crops [ 2 , 3 ] . since a single lepidoptera adult can produce hundreds of eggs , and their primary food source is typically plant material , they can cause significant damage to agricultural crops . although biological agents can help manage these insect pests , insecticides currently are essential for large - scale effective and economical pest control . \\n these insecticides can also affect non - target organisms , including pollinators , and their application not only disrupts natural ecosystems but also reduces yields of crops that rely on pollination [ 5 , 6 ] . \\n the non - target effect of some pesticides is in part due to their effects on insect immunity , which is necessary for insect survival in natural environments . \\n for example , currently used pesticides have been shown to affect cellular [ 710 ] and humoral [ 11 , 12 ] immune responses and interfere with grooming behavior [ 13 , 14 ] . \\n these effects on immunity are likely non - specific and negatively impact the health of both the target pest and beneficial arthropods . \\n therefore , there is a need for novel target - specific approaches to control insect pests without affecting beneficial arthropods . \\n although immune pathways can be generally and non - specifically inhibited by pesticides , they also are a likely source of candidate molecules that could be inhibited for target - specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes , including signaling pathways , can be under strong selection for diversification . \\n fundamental mechanisms of innate immunity comprising cellular and humoral pathways are conserved throughout the animal kingdom   and are controlled by signaling pathways activated by various stimuli [ 17 , 18 ] , including pathogen recognition by immune surveillance systems . despite this overall conservation , \\n aspects of immune systems are subject to strong selection to evolve in response to varying pathogen exposure and to pathogen evolution of virulence determinants that modulate immunity [ 15 , 1921 ] \\n . such co - evolutionary dynamics can promote diversification of conserved elements of immunity as well as the recruitment of novel effectors . \\n as such , the investigation of insect immune pathways and mechanisms of pathogen modulation can yield insights into components that may be susceptible to inhibition . \\n for example , the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila suppresses cellular and humoral immunity in the lepidopteran moths manduca sexta and spodoptera exigua [ 23 , 24 ] but not in the dipteran fly drosophila melanogaster , suggesting the stage of immunity suppressed by x. nematophila may be absent from d. melanogaster , but present in lepidoptera . \\n since dipteran flies serve as pollinators [ 26 , 27 ] , decomposers , food sources for other animals , and pest control agents , capitalizing on the possible differences between dipteran and lepidopteran immune signaling cascades will help in the identification of targets for pest - specific inhibition . with this knowledge in hand , \\n pest management can be achieved by developing small molecule inhibitors of these targets that will suppress pest insect immunity and lead to increased susceptibility to environmental pathogens . \\n indeed , many insecticides may contribute to insect ( target and non - target ) death by modulating aspects of immunity . \\n the feasibility of targeted pest control via insect immune inhibition has been established for termites ; a small molecule inhibitor of an immune surveillance protein led to faster termite death upon exposure to various pathogens . \\n much of our current knowledge of insect immune signaling pathways and receptor and effector function is based on the premiere model organism d. melanogaster , for which there are extensive genetic tools and several fully sequenced genomes . \\n well - established lepidopteran insect models such as the silkworm bombyx mori and the tobacco hornworm m. sexta also have been widely used to study insect immunity . \\n these organisms have been particularly useful for investigating hemolymph proteins and hemocyte function because of their relatively large larval size and hemolymph volume . \\n many insects in the order lepidoptera are easy to rear in laboratory conditions , and new tools such as rna interference have been implemented successfully to study genetics of their immune systems [ 30 , 31 ] . also , their immune signaling pathways are gradually being revealed by genomic and transcriptomic data [ 3238 ] . \\n based on these model insect systems a fairly detailed picture of immunity , from pathogen detection to effector function , is emerging , though many gaps remain , particularly with regard to components that are unique to different insect orders . here \\n we review aspects of insect immunity with an emphasis on the similarities and distinctions between d. melanogaster and representative lepidoptera . \\n in insects , the cellular immune response includes phagocytosis , nodulation and encapsulation [ 3942 ] and the humoral response involves the expression of antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) [ 43 , 44 ] as well as the pro - phenol oxidase ( propo ) proteolytic cascade that results in formation of melanized nodules and toxic reactive compounds [ 45 , 46 ] . \\n amps are small cationic peptides that insert into and disrupt microbial membranes , thereby killing and clearing pathogens . \\n they are synthesized by hemocytes and to a greater extent in fat body from which they are released into the insect hemolymph rapidly after microbial infection [ 43 , 47 ] . \\n amps are also expressed in extra - embryonic tissues of eggs , which may help protect the developing embryo from infection . \\n amps are a conserved component of immunity in plants   and animals   and while they have diverse structures most can be assigned to larger families such as cecropins , attacins , defensins and diptericins . \\n their diversity and immune effector function as well as their variant representation among insects ( table 1 ) have made them a central focus in the study of invertebrate pathology [ 30 , 52 ] . in d. melanogaster amp synthesis \\n each of these pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) that trigger , through complex regulatory cascades , nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) dependent transcription of the genes encoding amps . \\n after amps are translated in the cytoplasm they are released into the hemolymph where their high concentrations and broad activity are thought to enhance clearance of invading microorganisms from the insect . \\n bioinformatic and experimental data support the existence of the amp - inducing toll and imd pathways in lepidopterans , though not all components have been identified in model organisms such as m. sexta [ 32 , 35 ] . \\n the conserved presence of amps in immunity coupled with the possibility that certain elements of their induction pathways may vary among insects enhances the probability that microbially - induced amp expression could be inhibited in a pest - specific manner . as such , for the remainder of this review we focus on pathways leading to amp gene expression . \\n in d. melanogaster , transcription of amp - encoding genes is activated by the nf-b family transcription factors in response to infection [ 6569 ] with distinct nf-b family transcription factors responding to the toll and immune deficiency ( imd ) signal transduction pathways . in response to toll pathway activation , \\n the nf-b inhibitor cactus is phosphorylated and degraded allowing its targets , the nf-b factors dif and dorsal , to be translocated to the nucleus . \\n imd pathway activity culminates in the nf-b factor relish being activated by a stimulus - induced proteolytic cleavage . in the case of dif and dorsal \\n , gram - positive bacterial and fungal infections primarily serve as the stimuli that induce degradation of cactus through the toll signaling pathway . in general , gram - negative bacterial infections of d. melanogaster stimulate the proteolytic cleavage of relish through the imd pathway . once in the nucleus \\n , these transcription factors drive the transcription of immune effectors , including amp genes whose promoters contain nf-b binding sites [ 70 , 72 ] . \\n overall , nf-b proteins and their dna - binding specificities are conserved among organisms , including those lepidoptera studied to date [ 73 , 74 ] . \\n however , the nfb - binding regions for inhibitor of b ( ib ) proteins ( e.g. , cactus ) are not conserved , suggesting diversification and co - adaptation between ib and nfb pairs . \\n also , recent work indicates that nf-b nuclear co - regulators may contribute to species - specific regulation of amp gene expression . \\n therefore , modulation of inhibitors and nuclear - co - regulators of nf-b - dependent transcription may be one avenue by which target - specific immune suppression could be achieved . in d. melanogaster , \\n nf-b - dependent amp induction through the toll and imd pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) . \\n prrs are soluble or membrane - bound proteins that bind to specific microbe associated molecular patterns ( mamps ) such as lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , lipoteichoic acid ( lta ) , peptidoglycan ( pgn ) or -1,3-glucan that are released from or are found on the cell surfaces of bacteria or fungi . upon interaction with mamps , prrs can directly agglutinate pathogens or trigger proteolytic signaling cascades and cytokine release , which in turn lead to the activation of downstream cellular and humoral pathways , including pro - po activation and amp gene expression [ 16 , 65 , 76 ] . \\n pgn recognition proteins ( pgrps ) and -1,3-glucanase - related proteins ( grps ) were discovered in the lepidopteran silkworm ( b. mori ) by assaying for plasma components that activate the propo cascade . \\n pgrps were subsequently shown to be conserved across mammals and insects , and in d. melanogaster their role in the induction of amp gene expression through toll and imd pathways in response to pgn has been well documented [ 7983 ] . \\n similarly , grps have been shown to induce amp expression through toll pathway in response to fungal infections [ 79 , 84 ] . \\n in contrast , there is a dearth of literature linking specific pgrps or grps to amp induction in lepidoptera . \\n such a link is possible , since pgn and -1,3-glucan can activate amp gene expression in m. sexta and b. mori [ 8590 ] and multiple infection - induced pgrp- and grp - encoding genes have been identified in lepidoptera [ 32 , 38 , 54 , 55 , 9194 ] . \\n however , there are numerous hints that lepidoptera and diptera may have evolved divergent mechanisms of linking pathogen detection to conserved toll and imd signal transduction cascades . first , a genome comparison between b. mori and d. melanogaster failed to identify 1:1 pgrp orthologs . \\n similarly , b. mori gram - negative binding protein ( gnbp ) and m. sexta microbe binding protein ( mbp ) , members of the -1,3-glucanase - related protein superfamily [ 76 , 95 ] , appear to be distantly related to d. melanogaster gnbps , suggesting divergence of this group of proteins . \\n m. sexta mbp expression is strongly up - regulated in fat body after immune challenge and shows specific binding to lta , lps , dap - pgn . \\n also , in contrast to the situation in d. melanogaster , highly purified lps and lta are inducers of amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though not as potently as crude lps ( with contaminating pgn ) or purified pgn [ 85 , 90 , 96 , 97 ] . \\n this raises the possibility that different mamps or combinations of mamps are most efficacious in eliciting amp gene expression in lepidoptera relative to diptera . \\n also , since purified lps can elicit amp expression in lepidoptera but not d. melanogaster , lepidoptera have either a distinct repertoire of prrs responsible for lps - dependent triggering of imd or toll pathways , or an as - yet undiscovered pathway that links lps to amp induction . \\n testing these ideas awaits the identification of the suite of prrs and signal transduction pathways responsible for transducing lps , lta , pgn , or combinatorial microbial signals to amp gene expression . \\n one class of lepidopteran prr that may mediate infection - dependent induction of amps is the c - type lectins ( ctls ) , ca - dependent , secreted proteins that have carbohydrate - binding capabilities . \\n similar to some ctls of d. melanogaster , several ctls of m. sexta   and b. mori [ 54 , 99 ] are reported to mediate induction of cellular responses and the propo cascade . \\n although the nomenclature quickly becomes confusing , ctls include lipopolysaccharide - binding protein ( lbp ) . \\n m. sexta iml-1 binds to gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria as well as yeast , iml-2 shows specific binding to lps , iml-3 and iml-4 show specific binding to lps and lta , and iml-3 can also bind laminarin , a -1,3-glucan [ 103 , 104 ] . diversity in ctl \\n carbohydrate - binding specificities may result in lineage - specific pathogen recognition - signal transduction connections . \\n of particular relevance to the theme of this review are prrs present in lepidoptera but not diptera ( table 1 ) . in general , both orders of insects encode grps and pgrps . \\n however , specific representatives of each class are restricted to lepidoptera ( table 1 ) . \\n for example , the lepidopteran grp-2 , which binds fungal cell wall -1,3 glucans   and lta , is absent from diptera . \\n such derived grp and pgrps may contribute to lepidopteran - specific transduction of signals to downstream pathways . \\n other lepidoptera - specific prrs are hemolin and hemolymph proteinase-14 precursor ( prohp14 ) ( table 1 ) . like iml c - type lectins , \\n hemolin is an lps- and lta - binding prr   with roles in mediating cellular responses and as an opsonin to enhance phagocytosis . \\n hp14 has been shown to detect and bind a broad range of mamps , and may coordinate with grp1 or grp2 to activate propo [ 60 , 106 ] . \\n the potential role of the prrs discussed above in mediating the expression of amp genes remains to be determined , and further study of the lepidoptera - specific immune surveillance proteins and divergent activities of conserved prrs likely will yield novel avenues for pest - control . \\n d. melanogaster has both mamp - dependent and mamp - independent routes to activate the toll pathway . in mamp - dependent toll induction , bacterial lys - pgn ( typical of gram - positive bacteria ) \\n is detected by pgrp - sa or pgrp - sd ( in the presence of gnbp-1 ) , while yeast or fungal -1,3-glucan is detected by gnbp-3 [ 85 , 108 , 109 ] ( figure 1 ) . \\n mamp - independent stimuli are virulence determinants , such as proteases and chitinases , secreted by microbes and dubbed \\n mamps and mamp - independent stimuli each trigger a distinct proteolytic cascade   that both culminate in cleavage of the cytokine sptzle by the serine protease sptzle processing enzyme ( spe ) . \\n interaction of active sptzle c - terminal domain ( c-106 ) with the surface - localized toll receptor triggers an intracellular signal transduction terminating in induced expression of amps and cellular responses . \\n some of the basic components of the toll pathway are present in lepidoptera ( figure 2 ) . \\n m. sexta hemocytes express an infection - induced toll - like receptor and the genome of b. mori encodes 14 genes predicted to encode toll - like receptors as well as homologs of each of the intracellular components of toll - dependent signaling [ 85 , 114 , 115 ] . \\n both m. sexta and b. mori encode homologs of the d. melanogaster toll - activating cytokine sptzle   ( figure 2 ) . \\n also , for both m. sexta and b. mori there is experimental evidence linking the toll pathway with amp induction [ 116118 ] . in m. \\n sexta , toll pathway results in expression of several antimicrobial peptides , including attacin-1 , cecropin-6 , moricin and lysozyme . \\n in addition , the transcript level of hemolin , a pattern recognition protein exclusive to lepidopterans ( table 1 ) , is induced by injection of activated sptzle - c108 into larvae . despite the conservation of certain aspects of the toll pathway , the extracellular cascades that lead to sptzle activation may have diverged between d. melanogaster and the two lepidoptera ( figure 1 ) . \\n for example , in contrast to what is known in d. melanogaster , the m. sexta toll pathway is activated by gram - negative - associated mamps [ 115 , 118 ] . \\n also , the genome of b. mori lacks 1:1 orthologs of grass , spirit and persephone , the d. melanogaster serine proteases responsible for mamp / prr - dependent and mamp - independent cleavage of spe ( figure 1 ) . \\n progress has been made in identifying a m. sexta proteolytic cascade that results in processing pro - sptzle into its active c - terminal domain ( c-108 ) . \\n the direct cleavage is mediated by hemolymph proteinase ( hp ) 8 [ 11 , 13 ] , a homolog of d. melanogaster spe , in turn , hp8 is processed into its active form by hp6 . \\n hp6 is most similar to d. melanogaster persephone protease , which activates spe in response to mamp - independent stimuli [ 110 , 113 ] . \\n this hemolymph proteinase is activated in response to gram - positive or gram - negative bacteria and in response to -1,3-glucan . \\n however , the prrs and proteolytic cascade that transduce mamp signals to amp induction are unknown ( figure 1 ) . \\n the findings reviewed above demonstrate that while the overall architecture of the toll pathway is conserved among insects , the specific identities of proteolytic cascade members are distinct and many gaps remain in our understanding of toll activation in lepidoptera . filling these gaps should reveal potential lineage - specific molecules that can serve as targets to hinder the activation of the toll pathway in agricultural pests . in d. melanogaster \\n the imd pathway also contributes to amp gene induction and is triggered by direct interaction of dap - pgn , a mamp typical of gram - negative bacteria , with the transmembrane receptor pgrp - lc [ 82 , 83 , 125 , 126 ] . \\n for example , pgrp - le can act as an intracellular receptor for monomeric pgn   and its truncated form can enhance pgrp - lc - mediated recognition . \\n dap - pgn / pgrp - lc interaction activates intracellular imd , which then recruits fas - associated death domain ( fadd ) and death - related ced-3/nedd2-like protein ( dredd ) to form a complex [ 129 , 130 ] . \\n current evidence supports the idea that dredd , a caspase - like molecule , cleaves the nf-b transcription factor relish . \\n imd also appears to activate a phosphorelay : the transforming growth factor- ( tgf)-activated kinase 1 ( tak1 ) phosphorylates the ikb kinase ( ikk ) \\n relish cleavage into its activated amino - terminal transcriptional regulator domain allows its translocation into the nucleus , where it activates amp gene expression . \\n the translocation of relish into the nucleus is regulated by two recently discovered components of this pathway : inhibitor of apoptosis 2 ( iap2 ) and transforming growth factor - activated kinase 1 ( tak1)-binding protein 2 ( tab2 ) [ 132 , 133 ] . \\n both , iap2 and tab2 act upstream of relish and downstream of imd , while iap2 functions downstream of tak1 [ 132 , 134 ] . of particular importance to amp gene expression is iap2 , the knockdown of which hampers the sustained expression of amp genes . while iap2 and tab2 are necessary for imd signal transduction , the gene product of pirk , a recently characterized gene , interacts directly with imd and pgrp - lc . \\n pirk overexpression analyses revealed that it acts as a negative regulator by reducing the expression of the amp genes attacin b , cecropin b , and diptericin b , which are all under the control of the imd pathway . \\n most of the information available about the imd pathway in lepidoptera comes from bioinformatics ; orthologs of all intracellular components of the imd pathway have been found in b. mori [ 54 , 137 ] and m. sexta . \\n however , few experiments have been done to characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to activation of the imd pathway in these insects . in m. sexta \\n several genes of the imd pathway , including those encoding imd , fadd , tak1 , dredd and relish are up regulated in fat body of immune challenged 5th instar larvae   and in the midgut of b. mori during the wandering stage . \\n genes encoding lysozyme , moricin and defensin amps also were up regulated in the midgut of b. mori in the wandering stage , consistent with the possibility that amp induction is imd - mediated . finally , in the lepidopteran beet armyworm spodoptera exigua , rnai - mediated knockdown of relish expression resulted in loss of cecropin induction upon fungal infection , further strengthening the idea that the imd pathway may contribute to amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though perhaps it is triggered by distinct signals . \\n further study is needed to elucidate imd - mediated amp induction in lepidoptera and to reveal any differences there are in this pathway between diptera and lepidoptera . \\n in d. melanogaster , transcription of amp - encoding genes is activated by the nf-b family transcription factors in response to infection [ 6569 ] with distinct nf-b family transcription factors responding to the toll and immune deficiency ( imd ) signal transduction pathways . in response to toll pathway activation , \\n the nf-b inhibitor cactus is phosphorylated and degraded allowing its targets , the nf-b factors dif and dorsal , to be translocated to the nucleus . \\n imd pathway activity culminates in the nf-b factor relish being activated by a stimulus - induced proteolytic cleavage . in the case of dif and dorsal \\n , gram - positive bacterial and fungal infections primarily serve as the stimuli that induce degradation of cactus through the toll signaling pathway . in general , gram - negative bacterial infections of d. melanogaster stimulate the proteolytic cleavage of relish through the imd pathway . once in the nucleus \\n , these transcription factors drive the transcription of immune effectors , including amp genes whose promoters contain nf-b binding sites [ 70 , 72 ] . \\n overall , nf-b proteins and their dna - binding specificities are conserved among organisms , including those lepidoptera studied to date [ 73 , 74 ] . \\n however , the nfb - binding regions for inhibitor of b ( ib ) proteins ( e.g. , cactus ) are not conserved , suggesting diversification and co - adaptation between ib and nfb pairs . \\n also , recent work indicates that nf-b nuclear co - regulators may contribute to species - specific regulation of amp gene expression . \\n therefore , modulation of inhibitors and nuclear - co - regulators of nf-b - dependent transcription may be one avenue by which target - specific immune suppression could be achieved . \\n in d. melanogaster , nf-b - dependent amp induction through the toll and imd pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) . \\n prrs are soluble or membrane -

regulated in fat body after immune challenge and shows specific binding to lta , lps , dap - pgn . \\n also , in contrast to the situation in d. melanogaster , highly purified lps and lta are inducers of amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though not as potently as crude lps ( with contaminating pgn ) or purified pgn [ 85 , 90 , 96 , 97 ] . \\n this raises the possibility that different mamps or combinations of mamps are most efficacious in eliciting amp gene expression in lepidoptera relative to diptera . \\n also , since purified lps can elicit amp expression in lepidoptera but not d. melanogaster , lepidoptera have either a distinct repertoire of prrs responsible for lps -

c108 into larvae . despite the conservation of certain aspects of the toll pathway , the extracellular cascades that lead to sptzle activation may have diverged between d. melanogaster and the two lepidoptera ( figure 1 ) . \\n for example , in contrast to what is known in d. melanogaster , the m. sexta toll pathway is activated by gram - negative - associated mamps [ 115 , 118 ] . \\n also , the genome of b. mori lacks 1:1 orthologs of grass , spirit and persephone , the d. melanogaster serine proteases responsible for mamp / prr - dependent and mamp - independent cleavage of spe ( figure 1 ) . \\n progress has been made in identifying a m. sexta proteolytic cascade that results in processing pro - sptzle into its active c - terminal domain ( c-108 ) . \\n the direct cleavage is mediated by hemolymph proteinase ( hp ) 8 [ 11 , 13 ] , a homolog of d. melanogaster spe , in turn , hp8 is processed into its active form by hp6 . \\n hp6 is most similar to d. melanogaster persephone protease , which activates spe in response to mamp - independent stimuli [ 110 , 113 ] . \\n this hemolymph proteinase is activated in response to gram - positive or gram - negative bacteria and in response to -1,3-glucan . \\n however , the prrs and proteolytic cascade that transduce mamp signals to amp induction are unknown ( figure 1 ) . the findings reviewed above demonstrate that while the overall architecture of the toll pathway is conserved among insects , the specific identities of proteolytic cascade members are distinct and many gaps remain in our understanding of toll activation in lepidoptera . \\n filling these gaps should reveal potential lineage - specific molecules that can serve as targets to hinder the activation of the toll pathway in agricultural pests . \\n in d. melanogaster the imd pathway also contributes to amp gene induction and is triggered by direct interaction of dap - pgn , a mamp typical of gram - negative bacteria , with the transmembrane receptor pgrp - lc [ 82 , 83 , 125 , 126 ] . \\n for example , pgrp - le can act as an intracellular receptor for monomeric pgn   and its truncated form can enhance pgrp - lc - mediated recognition . \\n dap - pgn / pgrp - lc interaction activates intracellular imd , which then recruits fas - associated death domain ( fadd ) and death - related ced-3/nedd2-like protein ( dredd ) to form a complex [ 129 , 130 ] . \\n current evidence supports the idea that dredd , a caspase - like molecule , cleaves the nf-b transcription factor relish . \\n imd also appears to activate a phosphorelay : the transforming growth factor- ( tgf)-activated kinase 1 ( tak1 ) phosphorylates the ikb kinase ( ikk ) \\n relish cleavage into its activated amino - terminal transcriptional regulator domain allows its translocation into the nucleus , where it activates amp gene expression . \\n the translocation of relish into the nucleus is regulated by two recently discovered components of this pathway : inhibitor of apoptosis 2 ( iap2 ) and transforming growth factor - activated kinase 1 ( tak1)-binding protein 2 ( tab2 ) [ 132 , 133 ] . \\n both , iap2 and tab2 act upstream of relish and downstream of imd , while iap2 functions downstream of tak1 [ 132 , 134 ] . of particular importance to amp gene expression is iap2 , the knockdown of which hampers the sustained expression of amp genes . while iap2 and tab2 are necessary for imd signal transduction , the gene product of pirk , a recently characterized gene , interacts directly with imd and pgrp - lc . \\n pirk overexpression analyses revealed that it acts as a negative regulator by reducing the expression of the amp genes attacin b , cecropin b , and diptericin b , which are all under the control of the imd pathway . \\n most of the information available about the imd pathway in lepidoptera comes from bioinformatics ; orthologs of all intracellular components of the imd pathway have been found in b. mori [ 54 , 137 ] and m. sexta . \\n however , few experiments have been done to characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to activation of the imd pathway in these insects . in m. sexta \\n several genes of the imd pathway , including those encoding imd , fadd , tak1 , dredd and relish are up regulated in fat body of immune challenged 5th instar larvae   and in the midgut of b. mori during the wandering stage . \\n genes encoding lysozyme , moricin and defensin amps also were up regulated in the midgut of b. mori in the wandering stage , consistent with the possibility that amp induction is imd - mediated . finally , in the lepidopteran beet armyworm spodoptera exigua , rnai - mediated knockdown of relish expression resulted in loss of cecropin induction upon fungal infection , further strengthening the idea that the imd pathway may contribute to amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though perhaps it is triggered by distinct signals . \\n further study is needed to elucidate imd - mediated amp induction in lepidoptera and to reveal any differences there are in this pathway between diptera and lepidoptera . \\n insecticides are necessary to guarantee effective insect pest management in agricultural settings . however , the cost and off - target effects of these insecticides directly and indirectly increase economic burden ; the latter by affecting beneficial arthropods such as pollinators . the study of insect immunity can provide tools for the development of target - specific cost - effective approaches to control agricultural pests . directed suppression of pest immune defenses is predicted to render them susceptible to environmental and applied biocontrol pathogens , as recently demonstrated in termites by bulmer and colleagues . \\n the studies summarized above suggest that many aspects of insect immunity , including recognition factors and serine proteases , have diverged between d. melanogaster and lepidoptera . continued comparative immunity of a broad array of species from diptera , lepidoptera , and \\n other insect orders will reveal possible candidate immunity factors for target - specific approaches that will enable the effective control of insect pests . \\n however , before such approaches can be realized , the details of lepidopteran immune signaling pathways must be elucidated . \\n the relatively large sizes of last instar larvae of many lepidopteran species will facilitate biochemical approaches to such studies , while the establishment of immune - inducible lepidopteran cell lines such as the uga - cie1 cell line   can enable the characterization of molecular mechanisms leading to imd pathway activation and its contribution to amp gene expression . \\n finally , ongoing investigations into the immune - modulatory mechanisms of entomopathogens will help identify key steps in immunity that are susceptible to manipulation , contributing to the development of natural , cost - effective , non - toxic alternatives to chemical insecticides currently used for pest management .', 'syncope is caused by transient diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion and is characterized by transient loss of consciousness with a rapid onset followed by spontaneous and complete recovery . \\n clinical features of syncope may include myoclonic jerks which are often multifocal and asynchronous , convulsions , and urinary incontinence , making it difficult to differentiate from epileptic seizure by clinical features alone . \\n significant fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure are prevented by autoregulation of cerebral circulation , but there may be conditions where such mechanism may not compensate adequately . \\n cough syncope , a rare form of syncope , may be a result of transient failure of the cerebral autoregulatory mechanism to cope with sudden decrease in cerebral blood flow . \\n we present an unusual case of recurrent cough syncope , which was initially diagnosed and treated as seizures , in the context of a left - sided glomus jugulare tumor , a benign paraganglioma . \\n a 43-year - old right - handed woman with history of glomus jugulare tumor in the left jugular fossa with intracranial extension into the posterior cranial fossa was transferred from another hospital for recurrent seizure - like spells . \\n she had a 90% surgical resection of the tumor done in 2011 followed by radiation therapy in september 2012 . \\n her episodes occurred multiple times a day ( 7 per day on average ) during wakeful state . \\n they were triggered by coughing ( usually a bout of cough ) and were characterized by staring and unresponsiveness as well as stiffening of the body with mild shaking of both upper extremities . \\n she was diagnosed with epileptic seizures but continued to have episodes during treatment with the antiepileptic drugs ( aeds ) phenytoin , levetiracetam , and lamotrigine . \\n escalation of aed therapy made her increasingly drowsy , and she was on all three aforementioned aeds at the time of presentation . \\n her physical examination was remarkable for excessive drowsiness , mild dysarthria , right sixth cranial nerve palsy , mild hypertonia with hyperreflexia in the lower extremities ( left more than right ) , and bilateral ( left more than right ) ankle clonus . \\n she had a lumbar puncture done at the outside hospital , and the opening cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) pressure was reported to be 25  cm . \\n blood work was also unremarkable except for mild anemia ( hemoglobin : 9.4  g / dl ) , mild hyponatremia ( 132  meq / l ) , and mild hypokalemia ( 3.1  meq / l ) . \\n antiepileptic drug levels were within therapeutic range ( free phenytoin : 1.3  g / ml , levetiracetam : 5.9  g / ml , and lamotrigine : 2.3  g / ml ) . \\n all started with a bout of cough when the patient was lying in bed ( in supine or in lateral position ) which was followed by brief ( less than a minute ) distal upper extremity tremor and subtle proximal upper extremity myoclonic jerks and prolonged unresponsiveness for up to 10  min . \\n all of these episodes were associated with hypotension ( 7278/3147  mm of hg as revealed by continuous arterial pressure monitoring ) and bradycardia ( 5459  bpm ) . \\n the eeg during the spells was characterized by generalized synchronous and asynchronous high amplitude 1- to 2-hz delta activity which progressed to generalized attenuation and then transitioned to generalized delta activity again with recovery ( fig .  1 ) . \\n a head ct showed recurrence of the glomus jugulare tumor and communicating hydrocephalus . an external ventricular drain ( evd ) \\n after placement of the evd , her drowsiness gradually started to improve , and episodes decreased in frequency to one per day . \\n 3 showed an enhancing t2 hyperintense left skull base mass in the region of the left jugular foramen with extension into the posterior cranial fossa and below the base of the skull . \\n brain imaging showed evidence of hydrocephalus that had increased compared with her previous brain imaging done 2  months back . \\n her mental status continued to improve , and she had only one mild episode triggered by cough during the next two days before her discharge . \\n repeat surgical resection of the tumor was recommended by the otolaryngology team , which the patient declined . \\n based on the clinical features and eeg findings , the episodes observed in our patient are most consistent with cough syncope . \\n the mechanism underlying cough syncope is not definitively established , but it is postulated that coughing increases intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures leading to a transient increase in icp . increased icp , in turn , causes a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure which , if it drops below a critical level , may result in global cerebral hypoperfusion leading to syncope . \\n transient cerebral circulatory arrest has been demonstrated by transcranial doppler measurements during cough syncope . our patient also had a drop in blood pressure and heart rate but probably not sufficient to cause syncope by itself . \\n cough syncope has been associated with posterior fossa mass lesions or tonsillar herniation and with hydrocephalus . \\n it may be speculated that bouts of cough caused transient herniation of cerebellar tonsils obstructing csf flow that further contributed to the increase in icp during coughing . \\n decrease in frequency of events following placement of evd to relieve icp lends support to this notion . \\n paragangliomas are rare tumors of extraadrenal chromaffin cell origin that most commonly occur in the head and neck region . \\n catecholamine - hypersecreting paraganglionomas are uncommon in the head and neck region , and most patients ( 95% ) with hypersecreting paraganglionomas have hypertension . \\n hypotension accompanying syncope observed in our patient was not orthostasis - related ( the patient was always supine during spells ) and was most likely related to cough . \\n identified a subset of patients with cough syncope who lacked a blood pressure overshoot ( expected response ) after the relief of straining during valsalva maneuver . \\n the authors postulate that cough syncope in these patients might be the result of delayed recovery from hypotension that follows a paroxysm of cough , and this was likely contributing to global cerebral hypoperfusion in our patient . \\n this case highlights the fact that cough syncope , a rare form of syncope , may be associated with intracranial mass lesions that indirectly exaggerate the increase in icp in response to cough . \\n glomus caroticum tumor presenting as recurrent unexplained syncope   and posterior fossa meningioma presenting as recurrent cough syncope   have been described . \\n recurrent cough syncope should trigger search for factors , including brain tumors , with the potential to cause transient elevation in icp . \\n this case also illustrates an important role for ceeg monitoring with video in distinguishing syncope from seizures in cough syncope cases . \\n '], 'abstract': [\"background : the present study was carried out to assess the effects of community nutrition intervention based on advocacy approach on malnutrition status among school -

loops of the small bowel ct showing large pancreatic pseudocyst in the body and tail of pancreas bulging into the anterior abdominal wall and displacing loops of the small bowel traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts associated with peripheral ductal injury may resolve spontaneously or be treated successfully by percutaneous aspiration whereas those associated with injuries to the proximal duct head of pancreas require internal drainage by roux en cystjejunostomy the optimal point of drainage can be inferred from the ct scan where the cyst wall is thin and extrapancreatic but careful intraoperative assessment for dependent drainage is desirable 9 common misdiagnosis for pseudocysts are mucinous cystic tumours which make 4050% of pancreatic cysts and are radiologically similar to pseudocysts sample of the pseudocyst wall is sent routinely for histological examination to exclude the presence of an epithelial lining and confirm that the collection was inflammatory rather than neoplastic an inferior pseudocyst that bulges through the transverse mesocolon as in this case is preferentially drained into roux loop of jejunum this obtains dependent drainage and excludes the cyst contents from food and bile and should prevent activation of the pancreatic secretions until they are within the jejunum more rarely those at the head of the pancreas may be drained into the duodenum by cystoduodenostomy and those related to the tail of the pancreas are best managed by distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy if possible surgical intervention should be avoided until the pseudocyst is at least weeks old by which time the wall will usually be fibrotic enough to hold sutures continuous sutures are mostly used for cystgastrostomy so as to control haemorrhage from the pseudocyst wall or inflamed wall of the stomach postoperative complications may include flare up of acute pancreatitis haemorrhage from the suture lines or from the vessels of the wall of the pseudocyst as it collapses pancreatic ascites external pancreatic fistulae and recurrent pseudocyst formation the reported pseudocyst recurrence rate of 1020% following internal drainage is due either to inadequate stoma size failure to break down loculi within the pseudocyst or to persistent communication to the pancreatic duct the latter is characteristic of the post traumatic pancreatic pseudocyst due to associated duct injury after excluding mucinous cystic tumour via an eus guided fine needle aspiration of cyst fluid for analysis pancreatic sphincterotomy with or without stenting of the main

young women women are affected nine times more frequently than men about two thirds of patients develop cutaneous manifestations that may be visible transient or permanent rashes scars depigmentation skin dimpling photosensitivity and hair loss sle can affect different aspects of patients life leading to an impairment of health related quality of life qol the disease causes characteristic physical problems i.e chronic pain and fatigue and emotional problems i.e low self esteem and depression and these may decrease sexual interest and reduce intercourse frequency partnership difficulties arising from disease related stress can also contribute to less active sexual life for these reasons sle may affect all aspects of life including sexual functioning however the impact of sle on sexual problems has been less studied tseng et al have reported that 52.5% have impaired sexual function in taiwan sle patients however to our knowledge few studies have focused on the sexual problems in sle patients especially in chinese mainland body image disturbance bid is commonly defined as the distortion of perceptions or cognitions related to the weight or shape of the body bid plays an important role in anxiety depression and reduces the quality of life qol it has been reported that lymphedema patients with pain have higher levels of bid and decreased sexual drive severe bid is well documented in chronic diseases particularly those accompanied by deformities or disabilities such as ankylosing spondylitis as jolly et al have reported that bid is correlated with health related quality of life in sle patients recently studies have reported that vaginal pain symptoms poorer body image and fatigue are independent predictors of sexual dysfunction in young breast cancer survivors and sexual interest we have reported that chinese as patients exhibit bid and significant relationships are found among bid disease and psychological variables and qol interestingly we have found that disease activity and bid are the most powerful predictors of impaired partner relationships while disease severity bid and physical function are the most important causes of impaired sexual function in chinese as patients the psychological problems such as anxiety and depression as well as bid occurrence may impair sexual function and relationships the current study examines the independent association of bid occurrence with sexual function in chinese population in order to provide preliminary analysis of the clinical parameters disease activity physical functions and psychological parameters associated with sexual problems in sle patients as result the factors most closely linked to patient sexual status can be documented and considered in the design of

behavioural avoidance bidq7 as previously described the questionnaire design was based on modified questions of numbers 13 and 14 of the body image questionnaire provided in the digital form by the king college of london uk psychology.iop.kcl.ac.uk briefly the questionnaire first required participants to report the magnitude of the effect of their current emotional status on sexual relationship with current partners cronbach 0.73 secondly participants were required to indicate the impact of their current status on sexual function including sexual enjoyment and frequency cronbach 0.84 for each question participants provided ratings based on 9-point scale ranging from not at all to extremely questionnaires and other assessments were administered to participants from january 2010 to july 2011 written questionnaires were provided on papers and all participants completed the questionnaire under physician supervision in clinical setting the results were added to computer database by research assistants and double checked against the original data prior to analysis all data were expressed as means sd for continuous variables and as frequencies for categorical variables the statistical package was included in the stata v.10.0 statcorp usa software for all data management and analysis student tests were applied to assess parametric variables of independent groups while

causes of impaired sexual function 0.05 in sle patients table the associations among demographics disease related variables psychological problems bid and sexual problem in chinese sle patients are examined revealing that these sle patients are much more likely to have impaired sexual health and partner relationships than their healthy counterparts the current study is novel in that it assesses these parameters in group representing the chinese sle population these findings should be considered in clinical settings where sexual health is often overlooked during the treatment of physical symptoms the underlying cause of disturbed sexual function in sle patients is multifaceted though the physical aspects are most easily assessed the physical symptoms of impaired function pain fatigue and stiffness as well as psychological responses to chronic disease such as depression and insecurity can all contribute to sexual dysfunction have reported that pain fatigue and stiffness may interfere with normal sexual functions sle has been associated with substantial medical morbidity resulting in physical and occupational disability in study by boomsma et al 20% of sle patients believe that their illness would drive their family apart or worsen their relationship with their partners partnership difficulties arising from disease related stress can also contribute to less active sexual life have found that when compared with the controls patients with sle have significantly higher rate of abstention lower frequency of sexual activity among the sexually active diminished vaginal lubrication poor general sexual adjustment and more depression greater vaginal discomfort or pain during intercourse and difficulty in penetration due to vaginal tightness stein et al have demonstrated 10.5% of 120 patients have mild and 4% have major sexual problems depression is major cause of reduced quality of life in sle patients of both genders it has been reported that depression may be the principal factor contributing to sexual dysfunction in sle patients questionnaires as applied in the current study have been shown to be the effective methods of psychological and sexual health the current study has founded that marital and education status may contribute to the sexual function of lupus bid may adversely affect quality of life and result in psychosocial consequences such as depression social anxiety impaired sexual functioning and poor self esteem the effect has been previously demonstrated in body dysmorphic conditions and eating disorders and it may also affect sle patients with significant and chronic physical impairments alba and kes have reported the relation between body image and women sexuality and the sexuality in women with eating disorders similarly we have found that chinese sle patients also have poor body image which is inversely correlated with depression data not shown despite these initial indications few published studies address the correlation between bid and sexual problems in sle patients the current results show that except for consequential behavioral avoidance all other aspects of bid are significantly associated with impaired relationships with sexual partners the results of stepwise regression analysis in the current study demonstrates that age marital status and bid are most closely linked to impairments in the relationships of sle patients and their sexual partners while bid and education are most closely linked with impaired sexual functioning in sle patients interestingly the current study reports that distress along with impairments in social functioning and social life correlates significantly with impaired sexual function this suggests that the link between physical function and psychological factors may play role in the sexual health and perhaps even the overall quality of life of sle patients further studies will be required to assess whether psychological factors progress over time in chinese sle patient or if these symptoms have direct relationships with physical variables in such patients first the single center study design may mean results are not necessarily generalizable to broader population this is necessary next step as men and women have dichotomy of physical build and self perception of fitness third current treatments of sle such as prednisone and toxic immunosuppressive drugs may adversely affect body image thus further exploration of sle patients bid based on age gender and disease severity will be required to comprehensively supervise clinical prognostic guidelines and further analyses should be conducted with assessment instruments weighted for use in sle patients in summary the study for first time has reported chinese sle patients have sexual problem and bid is associated with sexual problems so early detection and interventions may not only rehabilitate the patient and their loved ones but also improve overall health outcomes and reduce the direct and indirect costs of their medical care discussions on changes in body image and the possible effects on patients with sle need to be encouraged from both sides by the patients and the physicians this requires major shift in the way we assess and provide medical care for these patients patients beliefs that doctors care for your body but do not care how you feel about your body should challenge our approach towards the care of these patients this requires interdisciplinary health care research clinical collaboration and above all shifting from biomedical model to biopsychosocial model increased awareness of the physical and psychological factors will aid rheumatologists and nursing specialists in initiating proper management of this subgroup of sle patients sexual health may be improved by treating bid along with the physical symptoms of sle.\",\n          \"the clinical aspects are varied including short stature acro osteolysis of distal

insertions the incidence of this anomaly is estimated to be 1.7 per million births actually fewer than 200 cases have been reported since the first description in 1962 the pycnodysostosis can be confused with other diseases such as osteopetrosis and cleidocranial dysostosis because they present some clinical and radiographically similar signs the malignant forms are recessive in which there is severe aplastic anemia caused by the obliteration of the medullary canals and early death usually the age of pycnodysostosis discovery is variable ranging from months to 50 years the pycnodysostosis seems to be favored by the high rate of consanguinity data already reported in the literature review in 38 of cases the short stature is constant feature it was present in our case and

parietal and occipital bossing 70.96% open fontanels and cranial sutures 64.51% grooved palate 48.38% midfacial hypoplasia 45.16% acro osteolysis of distal phalanges 38.70% narrow palate 19.35% open bite 16.12% the following dental findings were observed premature eruption of teeth persistence of deciduous teeth loss of permanent teeth malposition of teeth bone fracture caused by osteosclerosis was frequent 48.8% and in most cases transverse fracture was present at the midshaft of long bone 10 our patient reported multiple episodes of fractures after trivial fall two of the right tibia and one of the left tibia usually the medullary hematopoise is respected and there are no visceral manifestations although cases of extramedullary hematopoiesis and hepatosplenomegaly were reported in our case there was no anemia or organomegaly and the audiometry showed mild conductive hearing loss the deafness is exceptional in pycnodysostosis and has been reported in only two cases in the literature 11 ophthalmic reach has been reported only in one case in the literature and was represented by bilateral vitreous hyperplasia with lots of fibrous bands in adulthood the problem is mostly functional consisting of persistent short stature although maxillomandibulaires abnormalities are factor favoring upper airway obstruction sleep apnea has rarely been documented the main radiographic maxillofacial features were obtuse mandibular angle 94.28% large head with frontal parietal and occiptal bossing 80% open soft cranial sutures and fontanelles 77.14% multiple impacted teeth 48.57% absence or hypopeumatization of the paranasal sinuses 42.85% wormian bones 20% elongation of the coronoid process 14.28% and the condyle 11.42% supernumerary teeth 5.71% to date there is no specific treatment and the management of this disease remains only symptomatic the bone fractures are the main threat to patients affected by pycnodysostosis thus it is important to prevent or minimize the risk of fracture dental hygiene and regular dental checkups osteomyelitis is serious complication that may be due to oral conditions of the patient poor bone vascularity after teeth extraction or result of iatrogenic fracture the short size of pycnodysostosis is caused by the increased bone volume of the sella turcica that is responsible for pituitary hypoplasia and growth hormone deficiency recently growth hormone therapy has resulted in significant improvement in final height in pycnodysostosis we proposed also psychological management to help her to accept her dysmorphic appearance and control her fear of fracture risk therefore prenatal diagnosis when the mutation is known might be an appropriate approach by direct sequencing of the gene from fetal dna it is important to make the diagnosis as early as possible in order to plan the treatment and to provide better life quality to the patients we suggest an active screening of all patients diagnosed with pycnodysostosis for hearing defects and ophthalmological evaluation as new clinical feature of this disorder pycnodysostosis is rare condition that is diagnosed primarily on its clinical and radiographic features hence the importance of recognition of these features in the diagnosis of this disease to avoid debilitating complications.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

and microscopic findings of the colloid cysts have been clearly defined with the imaging characteristics depending on the protein content and inspissations of the contents to the formation of calcium

cilia and very rarely it is associated with 30-year old male presented with complaints of holocranial headache with transient episodes of blurring of vision for month he was investigated with mri brain which revealed hyperintense t1w and t2w solid cystic lesion measuring 2.9 cm in the anterior third ventricle causing hydrocephalus with enhancement on contrast imaging the solid portion was hypointense on t2w images and was nonenhancing on t1w gadolinium contrast images figure 1a mri t1w sagittal t2w coronal t1 contrast sagittal images showing solid cystic third ventricular lesion hyper on t1w and t2w images with hypointense solid portion and no enhancement on contrast post operative ct scan demonstrating the complete excision of the lesion with the catheter tip in the third ventricle the patient underwent right frontal craniotomy and the lesion was approached through interhemispheric transcallosal interforniceal route as the lesion was large and would have been difficult to excise from transforaminal variation of the transcallosal approach the lesion was solid cystic located in the third ventricle near the foramen of monro and contained about ml of machine oil like fluid which was drained the solid part of the lesion was avascular firm and grayish black in color which was excised the capsule was removed completely except for the part which was densely adherent to the floor of the third ventricle an ommaya reservoir was kept in the third ventricle for external ventricular drainage figure 1d the external drain was removed on postoperative day and ct scan was repeated on day to look for the residual blood in the ventricles there was dilatation of the ventricles with periventricular lucency for which right ventriculo peritoneal shunt was performed histopathological examination of excised specimen revealed all the typical diagnostic features of colloid cyst except for certain parts of the cyst wall where the simple compressed ciliated cuboidal lining lacked brush border and was sometimes entirely missing moreover the cyst wall was multilayered and thickened by granulomatous tissue which was composed of potpourri of cells there was predominance of epithelioid cells and macrophages many of which contained refractile material and hemosiderin polymorphonuclear leukocytes were diffusely scattered throughout the granuloma and lymphocytes were seen in focal collections histopathological sections cyst wall lined by single layer of cuboidal cells with underlying eosinophilic homogenous colloid and xanthogranulomatous reaction hematoxylin and eosin stain and 100 colloid contents cross hatched by cholesterol clefts and 400 magnified view of granulomatous reaction showing giant cells scattered lymphocytes admixed with neuropil material and 200 and high power view showing multinucleated giant cells and 400 the patient is under regular follow up and doing well with no fresh neurological deficits at end of year colloid cysts represent 0.5 1% of intracranial neoplasms and 55% of third ventricular lesions these benign neoplasms are usually located in the anterior third ventricles and are usually detected following obstruction of foramina of monro with features of raised intracranial pressure or sudden drop attacks due to intermittent cerebrospinal fluid pathway obstruction it may also present as memory disturbance due to forniceal compression or positional headache in minority of patients wang et al reported case of colloid cyst in the fourth ventricle with two episodes of aseptic meningitis managed by subtotal excision and repeated lumbar punctures webb et al reported acute vasospasm involving all the four major vessels following transcallosal excision of xanthogranulomatous colloid cyst and attributed it to chemical meningitis due to spillage of cyst contents akin to inflammatory reaction to craniopharyngioma fluid possible sources for these tumors include the choroid plexus ependyma primitive neuroectoderm and primitive endoderm whereas ultrastructural and immunohistochemical evidence argues against simple choroid plexus or ependymal origin microscopically the tumors are often described as being cystic and lined by single or multilayered ciliated cuboidal epithelium very rarely xanthogranulomas such as cholesterol crystal clefts foreign body giant cells foamy cells and inflammatory infiltrates of varying degree are seen in the wall of colloid cyst according to shuangshoti et al the xanthogranulomatous reaction associated with the colloid cyst may be due to desquamation of the lining epithelium and accumulation of lipid in the detached cells as they degenerate the lipids are released from the disintegrating cells producing xanthogranulomatous response in the denuded stroma they also postulated that the lining cells could serve as fixed histiocytes which could become wandering macrophages granulomatous cells after detachment other probable theories being hemorrhage and cyst rupture with colloid material inciting granulomatous reaction colloid cysts are hyperdense in two third of cases and iso to hypodense in one third of cases and density has been described to depending upon the cholesterol content of the lesion the predominance of cholesterol content in the cyst gives the colloid cyst its characteristic mr appearance of being hyperintense on t1 and iso to hypo intense on the t2 weighted images however other case reports suggest that as xanthogranulomas have different ct densities in different patients varying from hyper to hypodense with no enhancement on contrast with perilesional enhancement in few patients it may not be possible to distinguish them radiographically from the colloid cyst similar limitation has been expressed for mri also intraventricular glioma ependymoma craniopharyngioma and small dermoid should be considered in the differential diagnosis surgery is the treatment of choice which can be accomplished either by endoscopic or microscopic techniques as per the expertise of the operating surgeon we operated through interhemispheric transcallosal interforniceal variation as described by apuzzo et al although the interforniceal approach carries the risk of memory impairment due to injury to fornices it allows access to the middle and posterior parts of the third ventricle as compared to the plain colloid cyst these lesions are difficult to excise in toto as the inflammatory reaction to the xanthomatous material leads to adhesions and thence difficult total excision we were able to excise the cyst near totally except for the small part densely adherent to the floor of third ventricle kudesia et al reported iatrogenic aseptic meningitis in the postoperative period in their case attributing

cause of death from gynecologic malignancies and the fifth leading cause of death from all cancers in women the cytokine network in the tumor microenvironment may be involved in many aspects of tumor growth and spread such as proliferation motility survival cell cell or cell matrix adhesion neovascularization extracellular matrix remodeling host cell infiltration and local immune response in previous studies we have demonstrated that cancerous ovarian tissues cot express and secrete higher levels of il-1 il-1 il-6 and tnf compared to normal ovarian tissues not and suggested that these cytokines may have role in the pathogenesis of eoc 38 il-18 formerly known as interferon inducing factor is pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine with dual effects on tumor development and progression on the one hand il-18 induces helper type th1 immune response which is generally regarded as the immune reaction that acts against malignant tumors on the other hand il-18 promotes helper type th2 immune responses that may inhibit recognition of cancer cells by immune cells increase the adhesion molecules induce production of angiogenic factors and promote prometastatic microenvironment 11 12 il-18 belongs to the il-1 family of ligands it has 12% homology with il-1 and 19% homology with il-1 similar to il-1 il-18 is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein of 24 kda pro il-18 pro il-18 is processed to mature and bioactive molecule of 18.3 kda by the intracellular cysteine proteinase caspase-1 il-1 converting enzyme ice additional proteases can process pro il-18 to both biologically active form of the cytokine caspase-4 and an inactive molecule of 14 kda caspase-3 it consists of ligand binding domain -chain which binds il-18 with low affinity and signal transducing domain -chain together formed high affinity il-18r complex transduces its signal to stimulate the mapk pathway il-18 binding protein il-18bp is secreted 40 kda glycoprotein which possesses high affinity to il-18 this constitutively expressed soluble protein prevents the binding of mature il-18 to its receptor and inhibits il-18 biological activity four isoforms exist in humans displaying differential ability to bind and inhibit il-18 activity since its original description il-18 has been shown to be secreted by multiple cell types including and cells monocytes macrophages and some human tumors it is still unclear however which cell population is responsible for the elevated il-18 levels in the sera of ovarian cancer patients and how il-18 influences the development and progression of eoc the aim of the

epithelial and stromal cells figure cot showed differences in the expression pattern of il-18r in the serous papillary carcinoma and mucinous carcinoma tissues the cancerous epithelial cells expressed higher levels of il-18r than the stroma cells figures and resp in contrast endometrioid carcinoma expressed similar levels of il-18r in both stromal and cancerous cells figure il-18bp staining in not was high in the epithelial cell layer and weak in the stromal cells figure however while in the serous papillary carcinoma and mucinous carcinoma tissues the main il-18bp expression was by epithelial tumor cells figures and resp in the endometrioid carcinoma il-18bp was expressed in similar levels in both the epithelial cells and the stroma cells figure patterns of il-18 and il-18bp expression were similar in not and cot namely dominant expression of both cytokines in the epithelial cells in contrast there were differences in the expression patterns of il-18r in not compared to cot while cot showed il-18r expression that was similar to the il-18 and il-18bp expression patterns not expressed similar levels of il-18r in both stromal and epithelial cells il-18 is multifunctional cytokine that has critical role in ovarian physiologic function inflammation and immune response to cancer it can either facilitate or impede tumor development and progression within the normal ovary it is involved in follicular development and atresia ovulation and steroidogenesis in this study we have shown for the first time the expression levels and localization of il-18bp and il-18r in not and cot and cells we have also shown higher levels of il-18 in cot as compared to not the ratio of il-18/ il-18pb which indicates the actual echelon of il-18 activity was significantly higher in cot compared to not using immunohistochemical staining we have demonstrated that in both not and cot il-18 and il-18bp were predominantly expressed in epithelial cells il-18r was equally expressed in epithelial and stromal cells of not however in cot dominant epithelial staining for il-18r was observed specifically it can promote tumor growth and invasion by induction of th-2 immune responses inhibit recognition of cancer cells by antigen presenting cells thus allowing the tumor to escape immune surveillance increase vascular cell adhesion molecule expression and augment the production of angiogenic factors that may promote prometastatic microenvironment il-18 has also been implicated in anticancer activity which is mediated mainly through the stimulation of th-1 immune response it seems that il-18 initially stimulates the nonspecific arm of the immune response through the activation of natural killer nk cells and this is followed by the development of specific cytotoxic cell mediated antitumor response furthermore il-18 encourages ifn il-12 il-2 tnf il-1 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor gm csf production but decreases il-10 production the circulating levels of il-18 are increased in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer compared to healthy controls and patients with borderline ovarian tumors and early stage carcinoma 18 19 although macrophages were considered the main source producer of il-18 this cytokine is synthesized by many types of immune and nonimmune cells since il-18 mrna and il-18 protein were detected in primary ovarian cell cultures it is reasonable to assume that the elevated il-18 levels in ovarian cancer patient sera are produced by ovarian carcinoma cells as well as tumor activated immune cells by using elisa and semiquantitative rt pcr techniques we have shown that cot produced significantly higher levels of il-18 and il-18 mrna compared to not on the other hand while not produced significantly higher levels of il-18bp than cot il-18bp mrna levels in not were almost similar to those in cot most of the receptors are in the epithelial cells as depicted by immunohistochemical staining these results may indicate that in carcinomatous epithelial ovarian cells the higher level of il-18 is not counteracted by similarly higher level of il-18bp compared to normal epithelial ovarian cells therefore it seems reasonable to assume that il-18 is more potent active in ovarian carcinoma cells our findings implicate that the main source of il-18 in the ovary is the epithelial cells however the target cells for il-18 are different in normal and cancerous ovarian cells it is reasonable to presume that in mucinous and serous papillary ovarian carcinoma cells il-18 affects epithelial cells in an autocrine paracrine manner in normal ovarian cells and endometrioid type ovarian carcinoma cells il-18 binds to receptors in both stromal and epithelial cells thus different regulatory mechanisms control the effect of il-18 in the cell microenvironment of normal and cancerous ovarian cells il-18 activity expressed as the ratio between il-18 and il-18bp levels was significantly higher in cancerous ovarian cells compared to normal cells wang et al suggested that the ability to process il-18 is lost during neoplastic transformation particularly by downregulation of il-18 or of il-1-converting enzyme ice gene expression others 23 24 emphasized the importance of two single nucleotide polymorphisms snps at positions 607 and 137 in the promoter region of the il-18 gene allele at position 607 and the allele at position 137 were attributed to the il-18 higher transcription and protein production revealed the existence of an alternatively spliced variant of il-18 mrna which lacked exon-3 3pro il-18 this variant can not be cleaved by caspase-1 or caspase-4 to biologically active form but it retained the capacity to bind caspase-1 thus downregulating biologically active il-18 production il-18bp prevents the binding of mature il-18 to its receptor and inhibits il-18 biological activity therefore the intracellular and local concentrations of il-18 and il-18bp determine the biological effects of il-18 in physiological and pathophysiological context the majority of studies on serum il-18 levels in cancer patients do not provide concomitant information about the concentration of its antagonist that is il-18bp or il-18-inducible cytokines such as ifn in the same blood samples therefore it would be important to know whether il-18bp level is sufficient to counteract the pleiotropic effects of il-18 in the different stages and clinical conditions of cancer patients studies done to determine the prognostic potential of serum il-18 levels in ovarian carcinoma patients failed to demonstrate correlation with either stage or histology and it is clear that il-18 alone can not be used as specific marker of ovarian cancer in conclusion il-18 is novel cytokine with potent dual effects on tumor progression irrespective of its biological activity il-18 concentration significantly increases in the blood of ovarian carcinoma patients its production is pathophysiologic feature of cancer connecting inflammatory and immune responses to cancer progression however the regulatory pathways for il-18 production by both ovarian carcinoma cells and tumor induced host cells and its mechanisms of action remain to be determined to the best of our knowledge this is the first report to portray either qualitative or quantitative results concerning il-18r and il-18bp in primary cot nonetheless our knowledge on the effects of il-18 during human cancer development is still very limited and deserves further clinical investigation prior to considering il-18 or il-18bp to be potential therapeutic agents against cancer progression.\",\n          \"al habbah al sawda in arabic and black seed in english language black seed is commonly used herbal

with intermediate sensitivity to tq 10 and 20 ml and completely sensitive to tq 40 ml giving an mic of 40 ml whereas perfringens fragilis and thetaiotaomicron were relatively less sensitive to tq with

metronidazole against anaerobic human pathogenic strains summary of the results of estimated mics for tq and metronidazole against test anaerobes is given in table tq showed significant antibacterial activity against anaerobic bacteria used in the study particularly against difficile although much weaker than metronidazole anaerobic bacteria are normal commensals and reside in human skin and mucous membranes thus may cause endogenous infections such as diarrhea aspiration pneumonia lung abscess brain abscess and meningitis 11 16 metronidazole is very effective and commonly used for the treatment of anaerobic infections but unfortunately is relatively more toxic and can cause serious adverse effects including agranulocytosis besides metronidazole other effective antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria are the carbapenems imipenem and meropenem chloramphenicol the combinations of penicillin and beta lactamase inhibitor ampicillin plus sulbactam ticarcillin plus clavulanate and piperacillin plus tazobactam tigecycline and clindamycin the most frequently isolated antibiotic resistant anaerobe is fragilis but the clostridium species and other anaerobes are also becoming increasingly resistant in the present study also mics of both tq and metronidazole against fargilis were relatively higher than against difficile because of the limited published work for the antibacterial activity of tq against anaerobic human pathogens we could not find similar studies to compare our results however there was one study reported in the literature regarding the effect of tq on foodborne anaerobic bacteria and the results of our study were not much different from that mic of tq against clostridium species was from to 10 ml in the former study while in our study it was from 10 to 40 ml for difficile however derivatives of tq could be prepared and tested for their activity against anaerobes and might be as effective as metronidazole because some derivatives of tq were demonstrated to be much more effective than tq itself against cancer cell lines for example some analogs of tq when tested for their biological activity against pancreatic cancer cell lines were found to be more potent than tq in terms of inhibition of cell growth induction of apoptosis and modulation of transcription factor difficile is one of the most important microorganisms causing health care associated diarrhea i.e diarrhea secondary to the use of broad spectrum antibiotics cancer chemotherapy and immune suppressant drugs unfortunately data reporting the decreased effectiveness of metronidazole in the treatment of severe disease due to difficile have also been published in the present work tq was found to be relatively more active against difficile and further studies could be designed to investigate effectiveness of the combination of tq with metronidazole for the control of health care related diarrhea tq the most abundant active principle of sativa was shown to possess reasonable activity against anaerobic human pathogens tq was particularly more effective against difficile which is relatively common to cause diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals and those

            "Article: <start> a recent systematic analysis showed that in 2011 314 296 331 million children younger than years were mildly moderately or severely stunted and 258 240 274 million were mildly moderately or severely underweight in the developing countries in iran study among 752 high school girls in sistan and baluchestan showed prevalence of 16.2% 8.6% and 1.5% for underweight overweight and obesity respectively the prevalence of malnutrition among elementary school aged children in tehran varied from 6% to 16% anthropometric study of elementary school students in shiraz revealed that 16% of them suffer from malnutrition and low body weight snack should have 300 400 kcal energy and could provide 10 of protein day nowadays school nutrition programs are running as the national programs world wide national school lunch program in the united states there are also some reports regarding school feeding programs in developing countries in vietnam school base program showed an improvement in nutrient intakes in iran national free food program nffp is implemented in elementary schools of deprived areas to cover all poor students however this program is not conducted in slums and poor areas of the big cities so many malnourished children with low socio economic situation are not covered by nffp although the rate of poverty in areas known as deprived is higher than other areas many students in deprived areas are not actually poor and can afford food hence nutritional value of the nffp is lower than the scientific recommended snacks for this age group furthermore lack of variety of food packages has decreased the tendency of children toward nffp on the other hand the most important one is ministry of education moe of iran which is responsible for selecting and providing the packages for targeted schools the ministry of health moh is supervising the health situation of students and their health needs welfare organizations along with charities have the indirect effect on nutritional status of students by financial support of their family provincial governors have also the role of coordinating and supervising all activities of these organizations parent teacher association is community based institution that participates in school policy such as nffp in addition to these organizations nutritional literacy of students their parents and teachers is very important issue which could affect nutritional status of school age children therefore the present study was conducted with the aim of improving the nffp so that by its resources all poor children will be covered even in big cities moreover all food packages were replaced by nutritious and diverse packages that were accessible for non poor children according to the aim of this study and multiple factors that could affect the problem public health advocacy has been chosen as the best strategy to deal with this issue therefore the present study determines the effects of nutrition intervention in an advocacy process model on the prevalence of underweight in school aged children in the poor area of shiraz iran this interventional study has been carried out between 2009 and 2010 in shiraz iran this survey was approved by the research committee of shiraz university of medical sciences in coordination with education organization of fars province two elementary schools and one middle school in the third region of the urban area of shiraz were selected randomly in those schools all students 2897 13 years old were screened based on their body mass index bmi by nutritionists according to convenience method all students divided to two groups based on their economic situation family revenue and head of household job and nutrition situation the first group were poor and malnourished students and the other group were well nourished or well off students for this report the children height and weight were entered into center for disease control and prevention cdc to calculate bmi and bmi for age scores based on cdc for diseases control and prevention and growth standards the significance of the difference between proportions was calculated using two tailed tests for independent proportions for implementing the interventions the advocacy process model weight was to the nearest 0.1 kg on balance scale model seca scale standing height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with wall mounted stadiometer advocacy group formation this step was started with stakeholder analysis and identifying the stakeholders the team was formed with representatives of all stakeholders include education organization welfare organization deputy for health of shiraz university food and cosmetic product supervisory office and several non governmental organizations and charities situation analysis this was carried out by use of existing data such as formal report of organizations literature review and focus group with experts the prevalence of malnutrition and its related factors among students was determined and weaknesses and strengths of the nffp were analyzed accordingly three sub groups were established research and evaluation education and justification and executive group designing the strategies three strategies were identified education and justification campaign nutritional intervention providing nutritious safe and diverse snacks and networking performing the interventions interventions that were implementing in selected schools were providing diverse and nutritious snack package along with nutrition education for both groups while the first group poor and malnourished students was utilized the package free of charge education and justification intervention regarding the literature review and expert opinion an educational group affiliated with the advocacy team has prepared educational booklets about nutritional information for each level degree accordingly education of these booklets has been integrated into regular education of students and they educated and justified for better nutrition life style it leads the educational group to hold several meeting with the student parents to justify them about the project and its benefit for their children after these meetings parental desire for participation in the project illustrated the effectiveness of the justification meeting with them for educate fifteen talk show programs in tv and radio 12 published papers in the local newspaper have implemented to mobilize the community and gain their support healthy diet the importance of breakfast and snack in adolescence wrong food habits among school age children role of the family to improve food habit of children were the main topics in which media campaign has focused on nutritional intervention the snack basket of the students was replaced with traditional nutritious and diverse foods in general the new snack package in average has provided 380 kcal energy 15 protein along with sufficient calcium and iron low economic and malnourished children were supported by executive group affiliated with advocacy team and the rest of them prepare their snack by themselves research and evaluation in this step the literacy and anthropometric indices bmi of students were assessed before and after the interventions the reference for anthropometric measures was the world health organization national center for health statistics who nchs standards and the cut offs were two standard deviations sd from the mean each student that was malnourished and poor has been taken into account for free food and nutritious snacks demographic information height weight and knowledge of the students were measured by use of validated and reliable cronbach alpha was 0.61 questionnaire this project is granted by shiraz university of medical sciences charities and welfare organization and education organization of fars province statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences spss software version 17.0 spss inc the results are expressed as mean sd and proportions as appropriated in order to determine the effective variables on the malnutrition status paired test was used to compare the end values with baseline ones in each group in this project the who score cut offs used were as follow using bmi for age scores overweight sd i.e score equivalent to bmi 25 kg obesity sd equivalent to bmi 30 kg thinness sd and severe thinness sd this interventional study has been carried out between 2009 and 2010 in shiraz iran this

students and the other group were well nourished or well off students for this report the children height and weight were entered into center for disease control and prevention cdc to calculate bmi and bmi for age scores based on cdc for diseases control and prevention and growth standards the significance of the difference between proportions was calculated using two tailed tests for independent proportions for implementing the interventions weight was to the nearest 0.1 kg on balance scale model seca scale standing height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with wall mounted

shiraz iran table shows the frequency of subjects in different categories of bmi for age in non welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately among boys and girls before and after nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model in shiraz iran the frequency of subjects with bmi lower than sd decreased significantly after intervention among non welfare girls 0.01 however there were no significant decreases in the frequency of subjects with bmi lower than sd boys when we assess the effect of intervention in total population without separating by sex groups we found no significant change in this population table bmi for age for iranian students aged 14 years based on gender according to who growth standards 2007 bmi for age for iranian students aged 14 years according to who growth standards 2007 in non welfare and welfare groups of total population table has shown the prevalence of normal bmi mild moderate and severe malnutrition in non welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately among boys and girls before and after nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model according to this table there were no significant differences in the prevalence of mild moderate and severe malnutrition among girls and boys table also shows the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys the pre and post test education assessment in both groups showed that the student average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5 3.2 to 16.8 4.3 0.0001 bmi height and weight in non welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately in males and females before and after nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model in shiraz iran according to study finding the odds ratio or of sever thinness and thinness in non welfare compared with welfare is 3.5 or 3.5 confidence interval ci 2.5 3.9 0.001 furthermore the finding showed or of overweight and obesity in welfare compared to non welfare is 19.3 or 19.3 ci 2.5 3.9 0.04 the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio economic level according to our knowledge this is the first study which determines the effect of community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in big city shiraz in iran the other program in iran nffp is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools paying attention of policy makers to student nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem however negligence of under poverty line providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program advocacy by definition is blending of science ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions in the present study another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues it seems that in iran free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz at baseline no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre and post nutritional status intervention in contrast the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% which was identified as significant among impecunious girls students there was also significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age to sd most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population in the age range of the present study female although there is no nffp in big cities of iran there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children psychological test scores and the grade point average following this school feeding program the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents hence nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents although study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children in advocacy program audience analysis accordingly one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences we also took into account policy makers in different levels from national to local as primary audiences advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories but their benefits should be warranted another choice was community involvement which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish local factory that produced student snacks based on the new definition however there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges moreover providing supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require sustainable and continuous inter sector collaboration although in limited number of schools in our study interventions and advocacy program was successful expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level in this regard advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population as this population was children and adolescents we had limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject dietary adherence furthermore this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children provision of good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children. <end>\n",

            "Article: <start> it occurs in more than 50% of patients and may reach 90% in certain types of cancers especially in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.1 anemia is defined as an inadequate circulating level of hemoglobin hb hb 12 dl and may arise as result of the underlying disease bleeding poor nutrition chemotherapy or radiation therapy preliminary studies suggest that survival and loco regional control after radiation therapy especially in head and neck cancers may be compromised by anemia.24 anemia often worsens symptoms such as fatigue weakness and dyspnea and thus may have negative effect on quality of life qol and performance status in patients with cancer thus to improve physical functioning qol and prognosis in patients with cancer it would be reasonable to take proactive approach in identifying populations who need treatment for cancer associated anemia caa and provide timely management blood transfusion is an effective way to replace depleted hb within short period but the effect is unfortunately temporary and can cause serious adverse risks and increased mortality in randomized clinical trials in patients with caa erythropoiesis stimulating agents esas produced significant increases in hb level decreased transfusion requirements and improved qol.57 however 30%50% of patients do not respond to such agents in addition the use of esas often causes concern about severe adverse reactions.6 in several studies esas were found to shorten overall survival time or time to tumor progression in patients whose hb level reached more than 12 dl these studies included patients with different primary cancers such as breast lung head and neck cervix and lymphomas.911 the lack of response to erythropoietin stimulation in patients with cancer is partly attributed to the functional iron deficiency state in which the high rate of erythropoiesis exceeds the delivery of usable iron despite adequate iron stores.12 absolute iron deficiency in contrast occurs when iron delivery is impaired because iron stores are depleted serum ferritin 100 ng ml transferring saturation 20%.13 hepcidin peptide hormone produced by the liver is up regulated in chronic inflammatory states including cancer hepcidin inhibits iron transport across cell membranes thus decreasing the accessibility of stored iron and gastrointestinal absorption of dietary iron leading to an increased frequency of iron restricted erythropoiesis.1416 many randomized trials examined the role of intravenous iv iron in addition to esas in the treatment of anemia in patients with cancer many of these studies showed improvement in esa response time to maximal response reduction in esa dose and improvement in qol parameters when measured in favor of the combination over esas alone the observed benefit was independent of baseline iron parameters.1721 one study found 36% reduction in the number of patients transfused.21 this pilot study assessed the efficacy and feasibility of iv iron monotherapy in patients with cancer who have anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy without the use of esas patients received the

version 9.1 sas institute inc cary nc usa twenty five patients 17 women and men were eligible consented and included in the study their mean age standard deviation sd was 56 years 13.0 years chemotherapy varied according to the primary cancer and included anthracycline platinum taxanes cyclophosphamide high dose ifosfamide vincristine vinblastine bleomycin and others many of the included patients had their chemotherapy treatment as second or third line therapy patients characteristics including age primary tumor and active anticancer treatment are summarized in table one patient died during the study from his tumor after week and five patients withdrew from the study because of inconvenience three after week and two after week nineteen 76.0% patients completed minimum of three treatments 15 60.0% completed nine treatments and 14 56.0% completed all twelve planned weekly treatments as seen in table the mean hb level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 dl median 9.9 dl range 6.9 dl10.9 dl for the 15 patients who completed at least nine treatments the mean change in their hb level was 1.7 dl median 1.1 dl range 1.9 dl to 3.2 dl for the 14 patients who completed the whole treatment period 12 weeks the mean hb level change was 2.1 dl median 1.3 dl range 0.2 dl to 4.6 dl 0.0007 eight 42.1% of the 19 patients who completed at least three iron infusions had more than dl increase in their hb level hemoglobin level changes for the 14 patients who completed twelve iron infusions are shown in figure no iv iron related adverse events were reported among patients during the study or the follow up period tsat was monitored during the study period and no patients had tsat levels increase to more than 50% the highest ferritin level among patients who completed at least nine iv iron treatments was 170 ng ml the mean level at the end of study period for the whole group was 379 ng ml five 20.0% patients received blood transfusions and were considered treatment failures three after week transfused at hb levels of 6.9 dl 7.8 dl and 5.4 dl one after week transfused at an hb level of 8.2 dl and one after week transfused at an hb level of 7.2 dl low hb levels are associated with diminished qol and possibly decreased overall survival.2 successful treatment of anemia has undeniable benefits for patients often yielding dramatic symptomatic improvement although the role of esas is well established in treating caa big concerns were recently raised about the negative effect of esas on survival in some patients with cancer.911 concerns about the risk for thromboembolism in patients with cancer with higher hb levels who are receiving esa were also addressed in many trials.22 23 in addition the possible immunosuppressive effects of blood product transfusions that may have relevance to neoplasia progression were addressed before.24 25 in our pilot study we tested the feasibility of using iron supplementation alone to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy without the use of esas or blood transfusion which could be valid alternative especially for patients with curable cancers oral iron is easier to administer and relatively inexpensive but low patient adherence poor enteral absorption and poor tolerance because of wide range of troublesome gastrointestinal adverse effects limit its overall effectiveness.26 anemia of chronic disease may occur in patients with cancer and is associated with an increase in hepcidin levels which decreases oral iron absorption and bone marrow iron use negating any possible effect of regular doses of oral iron.15 iv iron therapy significantly improves response to epoetin alfa when compared with oral iron or no iron in anemic patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.1721 oral iron supplements with esas showed no significant benefit over esas alone in treating caa.21 sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose appear to have more favorable safety profiles over iron dextran large prospective safety comparison trial failed to show serious anaphylactoid reactions 27 which is confirmed in our study in which no patients developed reactions and no patients withdrew from the study because of adverse effects given that the mean hb increase using esas with iv iron in one large controlled trial was 2.4 dl 21 the results obtained in our study are clinically significant these findings should be further confirmed and better assessed in larger studies in which questions such as the optimal timing of iv iron therapy with respect to chemotherapy and the optimal total dose of iv iron should be determined the use of iv iron monotherapy was recently reviewed by group in germany that studied the use of ferric carboxymaltose to replace esa and blood transfusions as treatment for caa iron deficient patients treated with ferric carboxymaltose alone 233 had median of 1.4 dl increase in hemoglobin levels compared with those receiving additional treatment with esas 46 median 1.6 dl our study however is peculiar in using iron therapy in non iron deficiency state.28 iron overload after iv iron therapy with potential concerns about the risk of developing secondary cancers and infection might be raised the highest serum ferritin level in the present study in patients who completed at least weeks of iv iron therapy was 170 ng ml most of the literature addressing cancer and infections in iron overloaded patients comes from patients with hemochromatosis or patients who are undergoing hemodialysis published reviews report an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma only in patients with hemochromatosis after they develop cirrhosis.29 similarly data supporting the association between iv iron therapy and higher infection rate are weak and not well supported.30 in fact anemia itself is risk factor for infections in patients receiving hemodialysis.31 multivariate analysis of associations between iron and mortality in more than 58 000 patients receiving hemodialysis reported no increased death rate from serum ferritin levels as high as 200 ng ml.30 the increasing cost of therapy in patients with cancer is of grave concern which could be an additional benefit of iv iron over the use of esas in such patients to further address many of the questions raised our team is planning bigger trial for iv iron in patients with cancer who have anemia to confirm the results discussed in this pilot trial in addition we will be looking into predictors of response to iv iron such as serum hepcidin level iv iron therapy alone is safe and may be effective in improving hb levels in patients with cancer who are undergoing active anticancer therapy further randomized trials are needed to address many of the questions raised in our pilot study. <end>\n",

            "Article: <start> lepidoptera include agricultural pests that through feeding and other activities negatively affect stored grains food and fiber crops since single lepidoptera adult can produce hundreds of eggs and their primary food source is typically plant material they can cause significant damage to agricultural crops although biological agents can help manage these insect pests insecticides currently are essential for large scale effective and economical pest control these insecticides can also affect non target organisms including pollinators and their application not only disrupts natural ecosystems but also reduces yields of crops that rely on pollination the non target effect of some pesticides is in part due to their effects on insect immunity which is necessary for insect survival in natural environments for example currently used pesticides have been shown to affect cellular 710 and humoral 11 12 immune responses and interfere with grooming behavior 13 14 these effects on immunity are likely non specific and negatively impact the health of both the target pest and beneficial arthropods therefore there is need for novel target specific approaches to control insect pests without affecting beneficial arthropods although immune pathways can be generally and non specifically inhibited by pesticides they also are likely source of candidate molecules that could be inhibited for target specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes including signaling pathways can be under strong selection for diversification fundamental mechanisms of innate immunity comprising cellular and humoral pathways are conserved throughout the animal kingdom and are controlled by signaling pathways activated by various stimuli 17 18 including pathogen recognition by immune surveillance systems despite this overall conservation aspects of immune systems are subject to strong selection to evolve in response to varying pathogen exposure and to pathogen evolution of virulence determinants that modulate immunity 15 1921 such co evolutionary dynamics can promote diversification of conserved elements of immunity as well as the recruitment of novel effectors as such the investigation of insect immune pathways and mechanisms of pathogen modulation can yield insights into components that may be susceptible to inhibition for example the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila suppresses cellular and humoral immunity in the lepidopteran moths manduca sexta and spodoptera exigua 23 24 but not in the dipteran fly drosophila melanogaster suggesting the stage of immunity suppressed by nematophila may be absent from melanogaster but present in lepidoptera since dipteran flies serve as pollinators 26 27 decomposers food sources for other animals and pest control agents capitalizing on the possible differences between dipteran and lepidopteran immune signaling cascades will help in the identification of targets for pest specific inhibition with this knowledge in hand pest management can be achieved by developing small molecule inhibitors of these targets that will suppress pest insect immunity and lead to increased susceptibility to environmental pathogens indeed many insecticides may contribute to insect target and non target death by modulating aspects of immunity the feasibility of targeted pest control via insect immune inhibition has been established for termites small molecule inhibitor of an immune surveillance protein led to faster termite death upon exposure to various pathogens much of our current knowledge of insect immune signaling pathways and receptor and effector function is based on the premiere model organism melanogaster for which there are extensive genetic tools and several fully sequenced genomes well established lepidopteran insect models such as the silkworm bombyx mori and the tobacco hornworm sexta also have been widely used to study insect immunity these organisms have been particularly useful for investigating hemolymph proteins and hemocyte function because of their relatively large larval size and hemolymph volume many insects in the order lepidoptera are easy to rear in laboratory conditions and new tools such as rna interference have been implemented successfully to study genetics of their immune systems 30 31 also their immune signaling pathways are gradually being revealed by genomic and transcriptomic data 3238 based on these model insect systems fairly detailed picture of immunity from pathogen detection to effector function is emerging though many gaps remain particularly with regard to components that are unique to different insect orders here we review aspects of insect immunity with an emphasis on the similarities and distinctions between melanogaster and representative lepidoptera in insects the cellular immune response includes phagocytosis nodulation and encapsulation 3942 and the humoral response involves the expression of antimicrobial peptides amps 43 44 as well as the pro phenol oxidase propo proteolytic cascade that results in formation of melanized nodules and toxic reactive compounds 45 46 amps are small cationic peptides that insert into and disrupt microbial membranes thereby killing and clearing pathogens they are synthesized by hemocytes and to greater extent in fat body from which they are released into the insect hemolymph rapidly after microbial infection 43 47 amps are also expressed in extra embryonic tissues of eggs which may help protect the developing embryo from infection amps are conserved component of immunity in plants and animals and while they have diverse structures most can be assigned to larger families such as cecropins attacins defensins and diptericins their diversity and immune effector function as well as their variant representation among insects table have made them central focus in the study of invertebrate pathology 30 52 in melanogaster amp synthesis each of these pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors prrs that trigger through complex regulatory cascades nuclear factor kappa nf-b dependent transcription of the genes encoding amps after amps are translated in the cytoplasm they are released into the hemolymph where their high concentrations and broad activity are thought to enhance clearance of invading microorganisms from the insect bioinformatic and experimental data support the existence of the amp inducing toll and imd pathways in lepidopterans though not all components have been identified in model organisms such as sexta 32 35 the conserved presence of amps in immunity coupled with the possibility that certain elements of their induction pathways may vary among insects enhances the probability that microbially induced amp expression could be inhibited in pest specific manner as such for the remainder of this review we focus on pathways leading to amp gene expression in melanogaster transcription of amp encoding genes is activated by the nf-b family transcription factors in response to infection 6569 with distinct nf-b family transcription factors responding to the toll and immune deficiency imd signal transduction pathways in response to toll pathway activation the nf-b inhibitor cactus is phosphorylated and degraded allowing its targets the nf-b factors dif and dorsal to be translocated to the nucleus imd pathway activity culminates in the nf-b factor relish being activated by stimulus induced proteolytic cleavage in the case of dif and dorsal gram positive bacterial and fungal infections primarily serve as the stimuli that induce degradation of cactus through the toll signaling pathway in general gram negative bacterial infections of melanogaster stimulate the proteolytic cleavage of relish through the imd pathway once in the nucleus these transcription factors drive the transcription of immune effectors including amp genes whose promoters contain nf-b binding sites 70 72 overall nf-b proteins and their dna binding specificities are conserved among organisms including those lepidoptera studied to date 73 74 however the nfb binding regions for inhibitor of ib proteins e.g cactus are not conserved suggesting diversification and co adaptation between ib and nfb pairs also recent work indicates that nf-b nuclear co regulators may contribute to species specific regulation of amp gene expression therefore modulation of inhibitors and nuclear co regulators of nf-b dependent transcription may be one avenue by which target specific immune suppression could be achieved in melanogaster nf-b dependent amp induction through the toll and imd pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors prrs prrs are soluble or membrane bound proteins that bind to specific microbe associated molecular patterns mamps such as lipopolysaccharide lps lipoteichoic acid lta peptidoglycan pgn or -1 3-glucan that are released from or are found on the cell surfaces of bacteria or fungi upon interaction with mamps prrs can directly agglutinate pathogens or trigger proteolytic signaling cascades and cytokine release which in turn lead to the activation of downstream cellular and humoral pathways including pro po activation and amp gene expression 16 65 76 pgn recognition proteins pgrps and -1 3-glucanase related proteins grps were discovered in the lepidopteran silkworm mori by assaying for plasma components that activate the propo cascade pgrps were subsequently shown to be conserved across mammals and insects and in melanogaster their role in the induction of amp gene expression through toll and imd pathways in response to pgn has been well documented 7983 similarly grps have been shown to induce amp expression through toll pathway in response to fungal infections 79 84 in contrast there is dearth of literature linking specific pgrps or grps to amp induction in lepidoptera such link is possible since pgn and -1 3-glucan can activate amp gene expression in sexta and mori 8590 and multiple infection induced pgrp and grp encoding genes have been identified in lepidoptera 32 38 54 55 9194 however there are numerous hints that lepidoptera and diptera may have evolved divergent mechanisms of linking pathogen detection to conserved toll and imd signal transduction cascades first genome comparison between mori and melanogaster failed to identify 1:1 pgrp orthologs similarly mori gram negative binding protein gnbp and sexta microbe binding protein mbp members of the -1 3-glucanase related protein superfamily 76 95 appear to be distantly related to melanogaster gnbps suggesting divergence of this group of proteins sexta mbp expression is strongly up regulated in fat body after immune challenge and shows specific binding to lta lps dap pgn also in contrast to the situation in melanogaster highly purified lps and lta are inducers of amp gene expression in lepidoptera though not as potently as crude lps with contaminating pgn or purified pgn 85 90 96 97 this raises the possibility that different mamps or combinations of mamps are most efficacious in eliciting amp gene expression in lepidoptera relative to diptera also since purified lps can elicit amp expression in lepidoptera but not melanogaster lepidoptera have either distinct repertoire of prrs responsible for lps dependent triggering of imd or toll pathways or an as yet undiscovered pathway that links lps to amp induction testing these ideas awaits the identification of the suite of prrs and signal transduction pathways responsible for transducing lps lta pgn or combinatorial microbial signals to amp gene expression one class of lepidopteran prr that may mediate infection dependent induction of amps is the type lectins ctls ca dependent secreted proteins that have carbohydrate binding capabilities similar to some ctls of melanogaster several ctls of sexta and mori 54 99 are reported to mediate induction of cellular responses and the propo cascade although the nomenclature quickly becomes confusing ctls include lipopolysaccharide binding protein lbp sexta iml-1 binds to gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as yeast iml-2 shows specific binding to lps iml-3 and iml-4 show specific binding to lps and lta and iml-3 can also bind laminarin -1 3-glucan 103 104 diversity in ctl carbohydrate binding specificities may result in lineage specific pathogen recognition signal transduction connections of particular relevance to the theme of this review are prrs present in lepidoptera but not diptera table in general both orders of insects encode grps and pgrps however specific representatives of each class are restricted to lepidoptera table for example the lepidopteran grp-2 which binds fungal cell wall -1 glucans and lta is absent from diptera such derived grp and pgrps may contribute to lepidopteran specific transduction of signals to downstream pathways other lepidoptera specific prrs are hemolin and hemolymph proteinase-14 precursor prohp14 table like iml type lectins hemolin is an lps and lta binding prr with roles in mediating cellular responses and as an opsonin to enhance phagocytosis hp14 has been shown to detect and bind broad range of mamps and may coordinate with grp1 or grp2 to activate propo 60 106 the potential role of the prrs discussed above in mediating the expression of amp genes remains to be determined and further study of the lepidoptera specific immune surveillance proteins and divergent activities of conserved prrs likely will yield novel avenues for pest control melanogaster has both mamp dependent and mamp independent routes to activate the toll pathway in mamp dependent toll induction bacterial lys pgn typical of gram positive bacteria is detected by pgrp sa or pgrp sd in the presence of gnbp-1 while yeast or fungal -1 3-glucan is detected by gnbp-3 85 108 109 figure mamp independent stimuli are virulence determinants such as proteases and chitinases secreted by microbes and dubbed mamps and mamp independent stimuli each trigger distinct proteolytic cascade that both culminate in cleavage of the cytokine sptzle by the serine protease sptzle processing enzyme spe interaction of active sptzle terminal domain c-106 with the surface localized toll receptor triggers an intracellular signal transduction terminating in induced expression of amps and cellular responses some of the basic components of the toll pathway are present in lepidoptera

components of toll dependent signaling 85 114 115 both sexta and mori encode homologs of the melanogaster toll activating cytokine sptzle figure also for both sexta and mori there is experimental evidence linking the toll pathway with amp induction 116118 in sexta toll pathway results in expression of several antimicrobial peptides including attacin-1 cecropin-6 moricin and lysozyme in addition the transcript level of hemolin pattern recognition protein exclusive to lepidopterans table is induced by injection of activated sptzle c108 into larvae despite the conservation of certain aspects of the toll pathway the extracellular cascades that lead to sptzle activation may have diverged between melanogaster and the two lepidoptera figure for example in contrast to what is known in melanogaster the sexta toll pathway is activated by gram negative associated mamps 115 118 also the genome of mori lacks 1:1 orthologs of grass spirit and persephone the melanogaster serine proteases responsible for mamp prr dependent and mamp independent cleavage of spe figure progress has been made in identifying sexta proteolytic cascade that results in processing pro sptzle into its active terminal domain c-108 the direct cleavage is mediated by hemolymph proteinase hp 11 13 homolog of melanogaster spe in turn hp8 is processed into its active form by hp6 hp6 is most similar to melanogaster persephone protease which activates spe in response to mamp independent stimuli 110 113 this hemolymph proteinase is activated in response to gram positive or gram negative bacteria and in response to -1 3-glucan however the prrs and proteolytic cascade that transduce mamp signals to amp induction are unknown figure the findings reviewed above demonstrate that while the overall architecture of the toll pathway is conserved among insects the specific identities of proteolytic cascade members are distinct and many gaps remain in our understanding of toll activation in lepidoptera filling these gaps should reveal potential lineage specific molecules that can serve as targets to hinder the activation of the toll pathway in agricultural pests in melanogaster the imd pathway also contributes to amp gene induction and is triggered by direct interaction of dap pgn mamp typical of gram negative bacteria with the transmembrane receptor pgrp lc 82 83 125 126 for example pgrp le can act as an intracellular receptor for monomeric pgn and its truncated form can enhance pgrp lc mediated recognition dap pgn pgrp lc interaction activates intracellular imd which then recruits fas associated death domain fadd and death related ced-3/nedd2-like protein dredd to form complex 129 130 current evidence supports the idea that dredd caspase like molecule cleaves the nf-b transcription factor relish imd also appears to activate phosphorelay the transforming growth factor tgf -activated kinase tak1 phosphorylates the ikb kinase ikk relish cleavage into its activated amino terminal transcriptional regulator domain allows its translocation into the nucleus where it activates amp gene expression the translocation of relish into the nucleus is regulated by two recently discovered components of this pathway inhibitor of apoptosis iap2 and transforming growth factor activated kinase tak1 -binding protein tab2 132 133 both iap2 and tab2 act upstream of relish and downstream of imd while iap2 functions downstream of tak1 132 134 of particular importance to amp gene expression is iap2 the knockdown of which hampers the sustained expression of amp genes while iap2 and tab2 are necessary for imd signal transduction the gene product of pirk recently characterized gene interacts directly with imd and pgrp lc pirk overexpression analyses revealed that it acts as negative regulator by reducing the expression of the amp genes attacin cecropin and diptericin which are all under the control of the imd pathway most of the information available about the imd pathway in lepidoptera comes from bioinformatics orthologs of all intracellular components of the imd pathway have been found in mori 54 137 and sexta however few experiments have been done to characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to activation of the imd pathway in these insects in sexta several genes of the imd pathway including those encoding imd fadd tak1 dredd and relish are up regulated in fat body of immune challenged 5th instar larvae and in the midgut of mori during the wandering stage genes encoding lysozyme moricin and defensin amps also were up regulated in the midgut of mori in the wandering stage consistent with the possibility that amp induction is imd mediated finally in the lepidopteran beet armyworm spodoptera exigua rnai mediated knockdown of relish expression resulted in loss of cecropin induction upon fungal infection further strengthening the idea that the imd pathway may contribute to amp gene expression in lepidoptera though perhaps

lepidoptera insecticides are necessary to guarantee effective insect pest management in agricultural settings however the cost and off target effects of these insecticides directly and indirectly increase economic burden the latter by affecting beneficial arthropods such as pollinators the study of insect immunity can provide tools for the development of target specific cost effective approaches to control agricultural pests directed suppression of pest immune defenses is predicted to render them susceptible to environmental and applied biocontrol pathogens as recently demonstrated in termites by bulmer and colleagues the studies summarized above suggest that many aspects of insect immunity including recognition factors and serine proteases have diverged between melanogaster and lepidoptera continued comparative immunity of broad array of species from diptera lepidoptera and other insect orders will reveal possible candidate immunity factors for target specific approaches that will enable the effective control of insect pests however before such approaches can be realized the details of lepidopteran immune signaling pathways must be elucidated the relatively large sizes of last instar larvae of many lepidopteran species will facilitate biochemical approaches to such studies while the establishment of immune inducible lepidopteran cell lines such as the uga cie1 cell line can enable the characterization of molecular mechanisms leading to imd pathway activation and its contribution to amp gene expression finally ongoing investigations into the immune modulatory mechanisms of entomopathogens will help identify key steps in immunity that are susceptible to manipulation contributing to the development of natural cost effective non toxic alternatives to chemical insecticides currently used for pest management. <end>\n",

complete recovery clinical features of syncope may include myoclonic jerks which are often multifocal and asynchronous convulsions and urinary incontinence making it difficult to differentiate from epileptic seizure by clinical features alone significant fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure are prevented by autoregulation of cerebral circulation but there may be conditions where such mechanism may not compensate adequately cough syncope rare form of syncope may be result of transient failure of the cerebral autoregulatory mechanism to cope with sudden decrease in cerebral blood flow we present an unusual case of recurrent cough syncope which was initially diagnosed and treated as seizures in the context of left sided glomus jugulare tumor benign paraganglioma 43-year old right handed woman with history of glomus jugulare tumor in the left jugular fossa with intracranial extension into the posterior cranial fossa was transferred from another hospital for recurrent seizure like spells she had 90% surgical resection of the tumor done in 2011 followed by radiation therapy in september 2012 her episodes occurred multiple times day per day on average during wakeful state they were triggered by coughing usually bout of cough and were characterized by staring and unresponsiveness as well as stiffening of the body with mild shaking of both upper extremities she was diagnosed with epileptic seizures but continued to have episodes during treatment with the antiepileptic drugs aeds phenytoin levetiracetam and lamotrigine escalation of aed therapy made her increasingly drowsy and she was on all three aforementioned aeds at the time of presentation her physical examination was remarkable for excessive drowsiness mild dysarthria right sixth cranial nerve palsy mild hypertonia with hyperreflexia in the lower extremities left more than right and bilateral left more than right ankle clonus she had lumbar puncture done at the outside hospital and the opening cerebrospinal fluid csf pressure was reported to be 25 cm blood work was also unremarkable except for mild anemia hemoglobin 9.4 dl mild hyponatremia 132 meq and mild hypokalemia 3.1 meq antiepileptic drug levels were within therapeutic range free phenytoin 1.3 ml levetiracetam 5.9 ml and lamotrigine 2.3 ml all started with bout of cough when the patient was lying in bed in supine or in lateral position which was followed by brief less than minute distal upper extremity tremor and subtle proximal upper extremity myoclonic jerks and prolonged unresponsiveness for up to 10 min all of these episodes were associated with hypotension 7278/3147 mm of hg as revealed by continuous arterial pressure monitoring and bradycardia 5459 bpm the eeg during the spells was characterized by generalized synchronous and asynchronous high amplitude to 2-hz delta activity which progressed to generalized attenuation and then transitioned to generalized delta activity again with recovery fig head ct showed recurrence of the glomus jugulare tumor and communicating hydrocephalus an external ventricular drain evd after placement of the evd her drowsiness gradually started to improve and episodes decreased in frequency to one per day showed an enhancing t2 hyperintense left skull base mass in the region of the left jugular foramen with extension into the posterior cranial fossa and below the base of the skull brain imaging showed evidence of hydrocephalus that had increased compared with her previous brain imaging done months back her mental status continued to improve and she had only one mild episode triggered by cough during the next two days before her discharge repeat surgical resection of the tumor was recommended by the otolaryngology team which the patient declined based on the clinical features and eeg findings the episodes observed in our patient are most consistent with cough syncope the mechanism underlying cough syncope is not definitively established but it is postulated that coughing increases intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures leading to transient increase in icp increased icp in turn causes decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure which if it drops below critical level may result in global cerebral hypoperfusion leading to syncope transient cerebral circulatory arrest has been demonstrated by transcranial doppler measurements during cough syncope our patient also had drop in blood pressure and heart rate but probably not sufficient to cause syncope by itself cough syncope has been associated with posterior fossa mass lesions or tonsillar herniation and with hydrocephalus it may be speculated that bouts of cough caused transient herniation of cerebellar tonsils obstructing csf flow that further contributed to the increase in icp during coughing decrease in frequency of events following placement of evd to relieve icp lends support to this notion paragangliomas are rare tumors of extraadrenal chromaffin cell origin that most commonly occur in the head and neck region catecholamine hypersecreting paraganglionomas are uncommon in the head and neck region and most patients 95% with hypersecreting paraganglionomas have hypertension hypotension accompanying syncope observed in our patient was not orthostasis related the patient was always supine during spells and was most likely related to cough identified subset of patients with cough syncope who lacked blood pressure overshoot expected response after the relief of straining during valsalva maneuver the authors postulate that cough syncope in these patients might be the result of delayed recovery from hypotension that follows paroxysm of cough and this was likely contributing to global cerebral hypoperfusion in our patient this case highlights the fact that cough syncope rare form of syncope may be associated with intracranial mass lesions that indirectly exaggerate the increase in icp in response to cough glomus caroticum tumor presenting as recurrent unexplained syncope and posterior fossa meningioma presenting as recurrent cough syncope have been described recurrent cough syncope should trigger search for factors including brain tumors with the potential to cause transient elevation in icp this case also illustrates an important role for ceeg monitoring with video in distinguishing syncope from seizures in cough syncope cases

            "Abstract: <start> we present an unusual case of recurrent cough syncope in 43-year old woman which was initially thought to be seizures syncopal episodes were triggered by paroxysms of cough and were characterized by unresponsiveness and myoclonic jerks in her extremities she had left sided glomus jugulare tumor that extended into the posterior cranial fossa with evidence of worsening communicating hydrocephalus on brain imaging we postulate that bouts of cough produced increased intracranial pressure both by raising intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures as well as by transient obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow secondary to intermittent tonsillar herniation during cough this resulted in diffuse decrease in cerebral blood flow causing syncope the patient syncopal episodes decreased in frequency once an external ventricular drain was placed followed by ventriculoperitoneal shunt search for factors that can increase intracranial pressure seems warranted in patients with recurrent cough syncope. <end>\n",

            "Article: <start> anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson disease pd more so than overall cognitive status motor deficits apathy and depression 13 although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd yet our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices remains meager and lags far behind that of depression overall neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance for example higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini mental state exam mmse as well as tests of memory and executive functions e.g attention 1014 likewise apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction 10 1523 however few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd one study showed strong negative relationship between anxiety both state and trait and overall cognitive performance measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index within sample of 27 pd patients furthermore trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans i.e immediate memory visuospatial construction language attention and delayed memory two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left sided dominant pd lpd versus right sided dominant pd rpd however their findings were inconsistent the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety whereas the second study reported that in lpd apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks e.g tmt wms iii spatial span while in rpd anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks e.g clock reading test and boston naming test furthermore anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions taken together it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning it is also striking that to date no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory 26 27 we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety furthermore since previous work albeit limited has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition we also explored this relationship seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study see table the cross sectional data from these participants was taken from patient database that has been compiled over the past years since 2008 at the parkinson disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre university of sydney inclusion criteria involved diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson disease society brain bank criteria and were confirmed by neurologist sjgl patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed full neuropsychological assessment ten patients in this study pd with anxiety pd without anxiety were taking psychotropic drugs i.e benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders such as anxiety or if they reported score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale hads thus all participants who scored within depressed hads range were excluded from this study in attempt to examine refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney and written informed consent was obtained from all participants self reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd cut off score of on the anxiety subscale of the hads hads was used to identify pd cases with anxiety pda+ while cut off score of on the hads was used to identify pd cases without anxiety pda this criterion was more stringent than usual cut off score in effort to create distinct patient groups the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr stages and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson disease rating scale updrs in similar way this was determined by calculating total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 voluntary movement items 3643 and tremor items 5057 from the mds updrs part iii see table processing speed was assessed using the trail making test part tmt score attentional set shifting was measured using the trail making test part tmt score working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale iii raw scores language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the

whitney test depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions chi square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups all analyses employed an alpha level of 0.05 and were two tailed spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions as expected

were also no differences between groups in global cognition mmse 222.5 0.23 participants were split into lpd and rpd and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda importantly the groups remained matched in age disease duration updrs iii dde stage and depression but remained significantly different on self reported anxiety lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit

retention 75.5 0.39 compared to rpda this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set shifting and working memory in pd more specifically we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part which assessed attentional set shifting on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention and to lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety taken together these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in similar way as seen in young healthy adults 26 27 although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early premotor stages of pd related degeneration 37 38 such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei i.e raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus resp which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions over time chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries 39 40 which play key role in memory and attention recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls therefore chronic stress from anxiety for example may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients however losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd while noradrenaline reuptake blocker atomoxetine has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd 45 46 overall very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits for example lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology thus cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere e.g verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd however this remains controversial it has also been suggested that since anxiety is common feature of left hemisphere involvement 48 49 cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety although these results align with previous research interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd 30 50 in addition our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings based on these limitations our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd additionally the current study employed very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain future studies are encouraged to collect more complex and comprehensive battery from larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants e.g using dsm criteria rather than relying on self reported measures to group participants in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder e.g social anxiety phobias panic disorders and generalized anxiety influences cognitive performance differently in pd one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression although there was trend that the pda+ group self reported higher levels of depression than the pda group all participants included in the study scored on the depression subscale of the hads controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as key shortcoming in the majority of recent work considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd anxiety is key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options moreover anxiety has been suggested to play key role in freezing of gait fog which is also related to attentional set shifting 52 53 future research should examine the link between anxiety set shifting and fog in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be potential therapy for improving fog.

            "Abstract: <start> research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson disease pd has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly 50% of patients and its negative impact on quality of life previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients however to date no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety 17 pda+ 33 pda who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains simple attention visuomotor processing speed executive function e.g set shifting working memory language and memory new verbal learning results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part of the trail making task tmt compared to the pda group there were no group differences in verbal fluency logical memory or tmt performance in conclusion anxiety in pd has measurable impact on working memory and attentional set shifting. <end>\n",

            "Article: <start> small non coding rnas are transcribed into mrna but remain untranslated in eukaryotic cells they include sirna small interfering rna mirna microrna pirna piwi interacting rna and snorna small nucleolar rna mirnas are class of multifunctional singled stranded small rna which are 20 nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna although over 000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species as many as 000 to 10 000 mirnas per genome have been predicted mirnas regulate broad range of biological processes including timing of development cell cycle progression stem cell self renewal differentiation cancer initiation cancer cell proliferation metastasis and apoptosis 511 cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes although the current treatment of radiation therapy chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur as small non coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis they may represent novel cancer therapy unlike mrna mirnas are transcribed but never translated some mirnas are transcribed from non coding regions between genes deriving from independent transcription unit other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome deriving from the introns of gene transcripts 13 14 mirna gene copy number gain loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array based comparative genomic hybridization the results demonstrated high frequency 72.8% of gene copy number abnormality in mirna containing regions in human breast cancer wang et al collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non tumor tissues mir-21 mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls whereas mir-126 mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples our studies of the mir-17 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node positive compared with node negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via heterotypic signaling although the tendency for global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested general tumor suppressor function of mirnas subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation apoptosis cancer stem cell expansion and tumorigenesis mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type culture conditions target genes and pathway the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently 21 22 le et al described the

regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation fig 1mirna regulation of

regulate the g1-s transition mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in 50% of breast cancer the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition 23 24 in addition cyclin d1 is critical downstream target of erbb2 ras and -catenin induced breast cancers and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 mir-15/16 mir-23 and let-7 mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation 18 26 the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 92 as well as mir-15/16 was confirmed by deshpande et al the let-7 family functions as tumor suppressor in variety of cancers including lung colon ovarian and breast cancer schultz et al demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor nrf-1 to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis 32 33 furthermore cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle cell growth and epithelial to mesenchymal transition emt in breast cancer mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance facilitating g1-s phase transition thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation 36 37 moreover mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal like breast cancers the breast cancer basal like subtype specific mirnas mir-221 and mir-222 promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance the onco mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in wide variety of cancers including breast cancer 40 41 mir-21 induced cellular proliferation migration invasion emt cancer stem cell

breast cancer mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death pdcd4 in colon cancer mir-21 participates in dna damage induced g2-m checkpoint through suppressing the cell cycle regulator cdc25a recent report demonstrated the mir-21 regulates the cell cycle through targeting cdc25a in mcf-7 breast cancer cells with potential anti cancer chemical 3-diindolylmethane treatment mir-27a expression is upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines in mda mb-231 cells mir-27a negatively regulated the zinc finger zbtb10 gene and myt-1 thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation mir-27a suppressed myt-1 increased cdc2/cyclin activity and promoted the g2-m checkpoint in mda mb-231 cells thus distinct mirnas affect key genetic targets that govern distinct cell cycle checkpoints including cyclins cdks cdk inhibitors and the g2-m regulation apparatus in addition to cell cycle control breast tumor onset and progression and breast tumor stem cells are also regulated by distinct mirnas cancer stem cells cscs are characterized by their self renewal capacity an ability to differentiate into non tumorigenic cell progeny and their ability to seed tumors when transplanted into animal hosts cell surface markers such as cd44 cd24 cd133 epithelial specific antigen and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 are frequently used to isolate and enrich cscs the involvement of mirnas in regulating tumor formation by cscs or tumor initiating cells ic has been widely investigated let-7 expression is very low to undetectable level in embryonic stem cells es cells and increases with differentiation comparison of mirna expression between breast ic and non ic demonstrated reduced let-7 expression in ic and increased abundance with differentiation transduction of breast cscs with let-7 reduced the proportion of undifferentiated cells inhibited cell proliferation mammosphere formation and tumor formation in vivo clarke and colleagues identified 37 mirnas which were differentially expressed between human breast cscs cd44cd24lineage and lineage nontumorigenic breast cancer cells the mir-200 family members were downregulated in human breast cscs and normal mammary stem progenitor cells expression of mir-200 inhibited breast cancer stem cell expansion in vitro and suppressed the tumor formation ability of human breast cancer stem cell in vivo ectopic mir-34c expression reduced breast ics self renewal inhibited emt and suppressed tumor cell invasiveness via silencing notch4 zhu et al found the reduced mir-128 expression in human breast ic was accompanied by bmi-1 and abcc5 overexpression and associated with chemotherapeutic resistance and poor survival enforced mir-128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin induced apoptosis and dna damage emerging evidence has demonstrated the importance of cscs in cancer initiation cancer metastasis and drug resistance cscs are believed to be one of the most promising targets for cure of cancer the discovery that non coding rnas regulate cscs widens our understanding of cscs and may provide potential novel strategies for breast cancer therapy deletion of chromosome 6q including region 6q14-q16 is frequently observed in breast cancer the small non coding snorna u50 is candidate tumor suppressor gene in the 6q14 16 region playing role in the development and/or progression of breast cancer genomic deletion and transcriptional downregulation of snorna u50 was detected in breast cancer cell lines re expression of snorna u50 inhibited colony formation of the human breast cancer cells hs578 and mda mb-231 pirnas are small non coding rna that form rna protein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins pirna was initially discovered in germ line cells and considered as germ line specific small rnas emerging evidence indicates that pirna expression occurs in somatic cells 57 58 and piwil2 expression has been identified in human breast cancer cells high throughput deep sequencing identified group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines the study of these non coding small rnas in human cancer is just starting the identification of the expression signature of these non coding small rnas in breast cancer subtypes and an understanding of their functional significance to oncogene expression tumor initiation and tumor cell metastasis may shed important new perspectives on the role of these non coding small rnas in breast cancer small non coding rna based diagnostic and therapeutic applications for human cancer are expected in the near future although tumor targeted delivery and local administration are still major challenges to the practical application of gene therapy for cancer mirna based cancer therapeutic approaches are being established and tested in animal models synthetic mirna mimics or mirna expression vectors have been successfully applied to restore or overexpress mirna in vitro chemically modified lna anti sense mirna inhibitor and other approaches have been used to block mirna function in cells kim et al recently reported significant anti tumor effect of virus mediated delivery of mir-145 combined with 5-fu to treat breast cancer intranasal delivery of let-7 and intravenous delivery of mir-34a mimics for non small cell lung cancer treatment and virus mediated delivery of mir-26a for liver cancer treatment in mouse model demonstrate the promise of mirna for treatment of cancer dysregulated expression of mirnas has implicated components of the non coding genome as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors of breast cancer experimental evidence has shown specific mirnas regulating the initiation progression metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer via control of the cell cycle altering cellular proliferation altering cellular apoptosis and/or controlling the population of tumor stem cells dysregulated mirna expression has also been observed in cancer associated fibroblasts caf and in the systemic circulation 65 66 the circulating mirnas have the potential to serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer specific subset of dysregulated mirnas in breast cancer cells may serve as targets for gene therapy either alone or as an adjuvant treatment to current clinical protocols for breast cancer patients. <end>\n",

            "Article: <start> ohss is serious complication of ovulation induction occurring in 10% of in vitro fertilization patients rizk and aboulghar 1991 brinsden et al 1995 this iatrogenic condition has spectrum of clinical and laboratory manifestations ranging from mild to severe even life threatening conditions rizk et al 1990 among the serious manifestations of ohss are ascites and pleural effusion rizk and smitz 1992 vascular endothelial growth factor has emerged as one of the factors most likely involved in the pathophysiology of ohss geva and jaffe 2000 rizk and aboulghar 2010 vascular endothelial growth factor is an angiogenic cytokine that is potent stimulator of the vascular endothelium and appears to play an integral role in follicular growth corpus luteum function and ovarian angiogenesis rizk et al 1997 vascular endothelial growth factor causes increased capillary permeability with its sequelae of ascites and possible pleural effusion rizk et al 1997 gomez et al 2002 human chorionic gonadotrophin is thought to play crucial role in the development of ohss rizk et al two distinct forms of severe ohss have been described early and late forms papanikolaou et al 2005 mathur et al 2000 early ohss is caused by the administration of exogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin hcg and it starts before the 10th day after oocyte retrieval while the late form is the result of endogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin release in the event of pregnancy and it starts after the 10th day following oocyte aspiration papanikolaou et al 2005 such strategies included the use of low dose gonadotropins and frequent monitoring during controlled ovarian stimulation cycle cancellation coasting freeze all embryos and the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh agonist as an oocyte trigger in gnrh antagonist cycles rizk et al the use of antagonist in the luteal phase with total freeze of embryos to prevent severe ohss has also been suggested lainas et al 2012 such strategies should be used especially in patients at high risk for developing severe ohss including those who are young have low body weight have polycystic ovary syndrome those who experience high estradiol levels rapidly increasing estradiol levels high number of follicles during controlled ovarian stimulation and those with high number of oocytes retrieved rizk and aboulghar 1999 delvigne 2009 dopamine agonists have been proposed for the prevention of ohss in women at high risk however the study by lvarez et al 2007 suggested that it was only effective in reducing the incidence of moderate ohss but not in its severe form alvarez et al 2007 low dose aspirin therapy and doxycycline have also been suggested to inhibit angiogenesis fainaru et al 2009 2011 believes that the concept of an ohss free clinic has become reality the authors suggest that this approach should include pituitary down regulation using gnrh antagonist ovulation triggering with gnrh agonist and vitrification of oocytes or embryos devroey et al 2011 severe and critical forms of ohss are associated with significant ascites golan et al 1989 rizk et al ascites results in an increased abdominal pressure compromising venous return cardiac output and renal perfusion navot et al paracentesis is frequently needed as prompt drainage of fluid produces significant clinical and biochemical improvement including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process rizk et al multiple paracenteses may be required to relieve symptoms and avoid serious sequelae of hemoconcentration hypotension decreased renal perfusion and severe respiratory compromise instead of multiple interventions the placement of catheter temporarily for few days will permit complete drainage through one procedure rizk and aboulghar 1999 pigtail catheters have been used for drainage in various clinical situations in previous study we described the use of percutaneous placement of pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites caused by severe critical ohss abuzeid et al 2003 in this study we established the efficacy and safety of pigtail catheter drainage in the management of severe critical ohss in patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer at our centre between 1999 and 2001 on both inpatient and outpatient basis the aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with early onset severe ohss this is retrospective study that included all patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and developed severe or critical ohss by the golan classification golan et al 1989 in the period between 2004 and 2009 all patients underwent an ultrasound evaluation which documented the presence of severe ascites and bilateral ovarian enlargement all patients presented with shortness of breath marked abdominal distension nausea weight gain and lower abdominal pain thirteen patients complained of vomiting and patients reported decreased urine output less than 720 cc per 24 hours and had haemoglobin 15 dl all 33 patients were offered treatment using pigtail catheter insertion as an alternative to trans vaginal paracentesis blood studies including complete blood count creatinine electrolytes serum albumin and total protein and coagulation panel were ordered prior to the procedure all 33 patients were rehydrated with intravenous crystalloid solutions 0.9% normal saline care was taken to give the patient the same amount of fluid as the amount that was drained from the peritoneal cavity all pigtail catheter placements were performed in the operating room at our surgical centre the catheter french 2.0 mm boston scientific quincy ma usa was introduced utilizing non disposable metal gamete intra fallopian treatment gift trocar and cannula embryon gift catheter ivf online gilford ct usa which was introduced into the largest accessible ascitic fluid pocket in the upper outer quadrant of the abdominal wall under local anaesthesia and trans abdominal ultrasound guidance the trocar was then removed and glide wire boston scientific corp watertown ma usa was threaded through the gift canula the canula was removed with care so as to keep the glide wire in the peritoneal cavity the pigtail catheter was guided into the peritoneal cavity by the wire after removal of the stylet of the pigtail catheter the catheter was anchored to the skin using silk suture and it was supported by gauze which was covered by tegaderm the catheter was connected to three way stop cock which was connected to drainage bag initial amount of drained fluid was calculated and subsequently the patients were trained to drain 1000 cc per day 500 cc in the morning and 500 cc in the evening one liter normal saline and 500 cc of 6% hydroxyethyle starch solution hespan was administered to the patient on the same day of pigtail catheter placement any patient with critical ohss according to the golan classification or those in whom the presenting symptoms and signs did not completely subside after drainage of ascitic fluid and iv fluid replacement were admitted to the hospital for observation and further management all other patients were sent home once there was minimal or no drainage from the catheter the patient returned to the office for removal of the catheter the patients were encouraged to drink plenty of fluids and to increase their protein intake all patients kept diary for body weight abdominal girth and urine output before and after the procedure patients were seen in the office as needed for evaluation and hydration with normal saline demographic data including mean age years duration of infertility years bmi kg m2 and aetiology of infertility are illustrated in table ovarian

outpatient basis without any complications four patients 12% required hospital admission for days 2.7 three for associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis these three patients were admitted to the hospital immediately after insertion of the pigtail catheter for management of severe pleural effusion and careful observation one patient was admitted 48 hours after insertion of the pigtail catheter for work up for chest pain all tests were negative navot et al 1992 rizk and aboulghar 1999 but perhaps the most accepted classification of ohss is the one described by golan et al as mild moderate and severe golan et al 1989 however clinicians should be aware that ohss is dynamic condition and moderate ohss may progress to severe ohss within hours rizk and aboulghar 1999 rizk 2009 therefore the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine asrm proposed classification for ohss of mild worsening and serious the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine 2008 recognizing the patients at high risk prevention and early recognition are the most important steps in the management of ohss rizk 2006 however severe forms of ohss especially late onset type that occurs when patients are pregnant most likely will continue to happen albeit at much lower rate unless one reverts to total freeze of all embryos after the use of gnrh agonist as trigger shot in gnrh antagonist cycle donoso and devroey 2013 devroey et al 2011 traditional treatment consists mainly of supportive management until spontaneous resolution occurs rizk 1994 although moderate ohss does not usually require intervention outpatient monitoring is essential to identify progression to severe form rizk 2006 patients with moderate ohss can be managed on an outpatient basis by adequate hydration and close daily monitoring of weight gain and abdominal girth to detect progression to severe ohss and to provide intervention if required rizk 2010 patients presenting with severe forms of ohss are usually managed on inpatient basis and most patients with critical ohss are admitted to intensive care units for aggressive supportive measures to avoid maternal morbidity and mortality the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine 2008 correction of hypovolemia electrolyte imbalance and hypoalbuminemia are the basic principles during the treatment of severe ohss rizk 1994 2006 myrianthefs et al 2000 1992 suggested that paracentesis is the single most important treatment modality in life threatening ohss not controlled by medical therapy paracentesis and removal of ascites result in relieving the pressure on the inferior vena cava and improvement in venous return cardiac output and renal perfusion padilla et al 1990 therefore prompt drainage of fluid produces significant clinical and biochemical improvement including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process abuzeid et al 2003 the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine 2008 it is also possible that removal of ascites decreases the amount of vegf and its effects on vascular permeability therefore ultrasound guided drainage of the ascitic fluid should be performed in severe cases of ohss with respiratory distress oliguria or severe abdominal pain padilla et al 1990 this can be done either trans vaginally aboulghar et al 1990 or trans abdominally padilla et al 1990 however recurrence of ascites is common in severe cases of ohss placement of pigtail catheter has been proposed by some investigators to allow drainage of ascitic fluid whenever it accumulates without the need for further surgical procedures abuzeid et al 2003 in previous study we reported the use of percutaneous pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites in severe ohss as an alternative to repeated paracentesis abuzeid et al 2003 this procedure is relatively simple and requires short period of time as compared to the time needed to gradually aspirate any fluid accumulation transvaginally immediate relief of symptoms and signs of severe ohss after pigtail catheter insertion was an important finding in addition the ease by which any accumulated ascitic fluid was drained resulted in faster resolution of ohss abuzeid et al no infection was reported abuzeid et al 2003 in that study the first 13 patients they were discharged home with the pigtail catheter in place and managed on an outpatient basis until ohss subsided thereafter the catheter was removed the last 13 patients were managed on an outpatient basis without any problem abuzeid mi et al 2003 our previous study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the pigtail catheter for the management of severe ohss therefore we embarked on the current study to evaluate the role of pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with severe ohss syndrome in the current study we demonstrated that patients who were diagnosed very early with severe ohss can be managed safely and effectively on outpatient basis using pigtail catheter drainage iv fluid replacement and careful monitoring although all 33 patients presented with shortness of breath marked abdominal distension nausea weight gain and lower abdominal pain and 13 of them complained of vomiting all are criteria for hospital admission according to the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine on ohss 30 patients were sent home as their presenting symptoms were relieved early diagnosis and intervention resulted in rapid elimination of the symptoms of severe ohss and normalization of vital signs which allow us to manage the patients on outpatient basis the pigtail catheter placements were performed without complications and patients were discharged home after few hours of observation the patients who needed hospital admission were those with associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis another patient was admitted to the hospital for day for work up for chest pain and possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism once pulmonary embolism was ruled out she was discharged home with pigtail catheter in place and she was managed on outpatient basis outpatient management of ohss has no place in those who fail to have complete resolutions of their symptoms or those with severe hyperproteinuria or electrolyte imbalance certainly it has no place in patients with critical ohss such as those with severe pleural effusion diminished urine output severe hemoconcentration and those at increased risk of thromboembolic risks rizk 2010 it is imperative to stress that such protocol can only be used in patients who are motivated reliable and have the necessary support at home to allow them to return to the clinic or go to the emergency room if the need arises it also requires dedicated in vitro fertilization nurses to educate and follow up the patient on daily basis contrary to other reports that state that access to intravenous albumin is critical part of outpatient management for severe ohss we did not use any albumin replacement lincoln et al 2002 the reason behind the use of intravenous albumin is to increase intravascular oncotic pressure thereby curtailing the exodus of free water from the intravascular space in our study we used hespan instead of albumin as some investigators have shown that it is beneficial in reducing the incidence of severe ohss youssef et al 2011 by increasing the intravascular oncotic pressure in addition the majority of our patients had late onset ohss as result of pregnancy hespan should be used with caution in patients with late onset ohss only when benefits outweigh risks.it is fact that outpatient management of early severe ohss is common practice among infertility specialists after trans vaginal aspiration of ascitic fluid and iv fluid hydration outpatient management by repeated abdominal or trans vaginal paracentesis has been reported to be safe effective and cost effective lincoln et al 2002 shrivastav et al 1994 fluker et al 2000 1994 were the first to suggest that day care management in patients with severe ohss with abdominal paracentesis and iv hydration was simple safe and effective compared with traditional treatment with in patient hospitalization and supportive measures 2002 concluded that the need for hospitalization for hyperstimulated patients can be minimized by outpatient management of severe ohss with trans vaginal culdocentesis and rehydration with crystalloids and albumin 2000 advocated in pilot study an active management strategy for moderate ohss which involved early paracentesis designed to minimize the progression from moderate to severe ohss instead of late paracentesis aimed at speeding up recovery in severely ill patients 2010 concluded that early outpatient paracentesis for moderate to severe ohss is the most cost effective management plan when compared with traditional conservative inpatient therapy 2009 reported large series of patients with severe ohss in whom the vast majority were successfully managed as outpatients with use of aggressive trans vaginal paracentesis smith et al 2009 despite the findings in our study it is important to emphasize that ohss remains serious disorder with the potential for rapid deterioration requiring hospitalization and intensive treatment of critically ill patient the life threatening complications of ohss are secondary to thromboembolism or compromised pulmonary or cardiovascular function and multi organ failure there have been isolated reports of women dying from the complications associated with ohss the mortality rate related to ohss is very low and was estimated by brinsden et al more recently reports regarding maternal mortality rates due to ohss in the netherlands and united kingdom demonstrate an incidence of approximately deaths per 100 000 in ivf cycles braat et al 2006 lewis 2007 eleven lethal complications of assisted reproductive technology have been documented and summarized by braat et al several investigators reported sporadic fatality as result of ohss due to adult respiratory distress syndrome massive pulmonary oedema myocardial infarction and carotid artery occlusion resulting in cerebral infarction in this study we describe modified technique of what interventional radiologists usually use for pigtail catheter placement we observed that in the obese patients the metal introducer provided in the pigtail catheter kit is difficult to use instead we used the non disposable gamete intra fallopian treatment trocar and cannula to facilitate the introduction of the catheter through the abdominal wall of such patients this technique helps to manage the patients in the office without the need for sending her to the hospital for an interventional radiologist to place the catheter however the patients in this study were identified from our in vitro fertilization database the study included every patient who developed severe critical ohss in addition the lack of control group that was managed without pigtail catheter placement limits the conclusions that can be drawn from our study in summary drainage of ascitic fluid in patients with severe critical ohss is an important step in the management of this condition rizk 2010 the placement of pigtail catheter resulted in safe and effective outpatient management of the majority of patients with severe ohss however outpatient management of this potentially fatal condition requires clear understanding that rapid deterioration may occur which may necessitate hospitalization and intensive treatment of critically ill patient rizk 2006 2010 patients with critical ohss and those with persistence of symptoms of severe ohss despite insertion of pigtail catheter and drainage of ascitic fluid should be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management. <end>\n",

non obese diabetic nod mice biobreeding rats or diabetes induced in susceptible rodent strains by multiple low doses of streptozotocin mlds are now available in the pathogenesis of t1d several proinflamma tory cytokines including ifn tnf il-1 as well as il-17 have been implicated it is also thought that the production of anti inflammatory cytokines such as il-4 il-10 and tgf correlates with protection from t1d it has been shown that some drugs such as pentoxifylline ptx have immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory activity which might represent potential preventive therapy for autoimmune diseases ptx is methyl xanthine derived general phosphodiesterase pde inhibitor that has been available for many years to treat vascular disorder phosphodiesterases pdes are family of enzymes that regulate intracellular levels of the cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp and cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp by catalyzing their breakdown to inactive metabolites drugs that increase the levels of camp tend to reduce the production of proinflammatory mediators and increase the production of anti inflammatory mediators by immune cells in recent years the potential of ptx as an immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory agent gained interest as it has been shown to effectively suppress the synthesis of tnf and other pro inflammatory cytokines such as ifn and il-12 in vitro

commonly used animal model that has many histological and clinical features similar to those of human type diabetes and involves the participation of macrophages and cells streptozotocin stz is pancreatic cell toxin that induces inflammation of the islets by immune cells when it is given in multiple low doses 16 this model of diabetes offers some advantages such as simultaneous appearance of diabetes mellitus in all animals and not having immune abnormalities that may complicate studies in spontaneous diabetes in non obese diabetic nod mice or bio breeding bb rats therefore this model as good model has been applied extensively to investigate the type diabetes mellitus especially study the immune pathways and modulations of autoimmune insulitis and cell death 17 18 c57bl/6 mice also called c57 black or simply black has the advantage of strain stability and easy breeding the most common application of c57bl/6 mice is to serve as physiological or pathological models for in vivo experiments 19 as such mlds induced c57bl/6j mice were chosen to evaluate the anti hyperglycemic activity of ptx and investigate the immunotherapeutic molecular mechanisms of how ptx attenuated the development of t1d ptx is commonly used for the treatment of microcirculatory disorders and yields only minimal side effects in patients in addition due to its varied immunomodulatory effects ptx has been used in several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis 20 multiple sclerosis 21 and systemic lupus erythematosus 22 drugs that increase the level of camp including pde inhibitors are known to prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses 20 previous studies have also shown that ptx lowers blood glucose levels in diabetic animals 23 and the results from the present studies also indicated that ptx possessed an anti hyperglycemic property more importantly the present data demonstrated that ptx could increase serum insulin concentrations in type diabetic mice it has been shown that ptx could reduce but not abrogate the insulin requirements or lengthen the honeymoon non insulin requiring period in study of 21 children with new onset type 1diabetes 24 helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines tnf ifn il-1 il-6 and il-12 which activate macrophages and cytotoxic cells to destroy -cells whereas anti inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 that are produced by activated helper cells prevent -cell destructive insulitis 25 il-10 has been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in mice 26 in response to cytokine stimulation -cells generate reactive oxygen species ross and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide no which facilitate their destruction 27 no is also synthesized within cytokine activated macrophages by inducible nitric oxide synthase inos 28 more recently the role of il-17-producing cells have been demonstrated in the development of several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and type diabetes il-17 is proinflammatory cytokine that is detrimental to pancreatic islet cells 29 il-17 promotes infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages stimulates the production of other proinflammatory cytokines including tnf il-1 il-6 and il-12 by activated macrophages and induces nitric oxide release from cells that interferes with their function and cause -cell destruction 30 it has been assumed that ptx similar to camp elevating agents selectively suppresses the production of helper type il-2 ifn but not helper type il-4 il-6 il-10 cytokines 31 however it has also been demonstrated that the effect of ptx on cytokine production is cell specific 32 the present study shows that ptx is not only able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines ifn and il-17 but can also increase the production of anti inflammatory cytokines il-10 since ptx has been found to be able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines 33 and favor th2 response 34 it may indirectly interfere with the induction of inos it has been shown that pde inhibitors elevate camp prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses 35 and suppress proliferation of lymphocytes 36 our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that ptx treatment prevented lymphocyte proliferation in summary results of the present work demonstrated that the suppressive effect of the ptx treatment on t1d was accompanied by decreased blood glucose level increased plasma insulin level suppression of cell proliferation down regulation of th1 and th17 cytokines ifn and il-17 and increase in the production of il-10 in supernatant of splenic culture of the treated mice it seems that pentoxifylline treatment has therapeutic effect against mlds induced diabetes in mice. <end>\n",
            "Abstract: <start> objective :pentoxifylline is an immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory agent and is used in vascular disorders it has been shown that pentoxifylline inhibits proinflammatory cytokines production the purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of pentoxifylline on the treatment of autoimmune diabetes in mice.materials and methods diabetes was induced by multiple low dose of streptozotocin mlds injection 40 mg kg day for consecutive days in male c57bl/6 mice after induction of diabetes mice were treated with pentoxifylline 100 mg kg day ip for 21 days blood glucose levels and plasma levels of insulin were measured splenocytes were tested for proliferation by mtt test and cytokine production by elisa.results:pentoxifylline treatment prevented hyperglycemia and increased plasma insulin levels in the diabetic mice aside from reducing lymphocyte proliferation pentoxifylline significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory interleukin 17 il-17 as well as interferon gamma ifn while increased anti inflammatory cytokine il-10 as compared with those in mlds group diabetic control group.conclusion these findings indicate that pentoxifylline may have therapeutic effect against the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells during the development of mlds induced type diabetes in mice. <end>\n",

approximately one third of patients with symptomatic vte manifests pe whereas two thirds manifest dvt alone both dvt and pe can be clinically silent asymptomatic and hence not suspected if undiagnosed asymptomatic vte can lead to chronic venous disease or recurrent vte and long term debilitating sequelae such as postthrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension vte is not only disabling but also prolongs hospital stay and increases the cost of treatment along with myocardial infarction and arrhythmia due to electrolyte imbalance pe is one of the commonest causes of sudden unexplained deaths in hospitalized patients it is estimated that 20 million cases of lower extremity dvt occur in the usa alone the prevailing notion that the incidence of vte in asians is less than that in the western population has been disproved by recent studies the incidence of postoperative dvt in indian patients undergoing major lower limb surgery is as high 43.2% and 60% patients in the groups with and without prophylaxis respectively as seen in the western world given the growing burden of vte in india and lack of substantial indian data on characteristics of vte patients use of diagnostics tools prophylaxis treatment options and clinical outcomes in vte there was need to systematically collect such data data on patient characteristics clinical outcomes predictors of

incidence of acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism over years period 20062010 at three sites to our knowledge this is the first multicenter retrospective registry in india involving patients with vte that reflect real world clinical practice in contrast with the western data in which vte is predominantly disease of older age 44% patients in our study were between 40 and 59 years of age while 34% were below 40 years particularly those with pe in study from north india men constituted 70% of our registry more than those reported from vellore registry 48% but similar to those reported in the endorse epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for vte in the acute hospital care setting study 69% one of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine thrombophilia marker in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study fewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis this is supported by the fact that only 1% of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy total of 28% of the overall referrals were from cardiologists the majority 82% of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical 15% specialties as against referral rate of 93% from surgeons at vellore our finding complements that from the endorse study in which 55% of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease majority 53% of patients in our study had co morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus it is possible that these patients visited cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist investigator most 89% of these patients had swelling of the lower limb it is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit specialist for symptom like swelling of limb instead visited their family physician it is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to specialist patients with history of vte are about times more likely to develop new episode during subsequent high risk period compared with patients without history of dvt or pe prior history of dvt was the most 34% common risk factor in patients who had only dvt whereas past history of pe trauma and immobilization for more than days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe our results major lower limb surgery as risk factor in 3% patients appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study which reported dvt in 4.4% patients undergoing major lower limb surgery other studies from india have reported dvt incidence rate ranging from 8% to 20% in major lower limb surgery however in our study only 7% of patients had malignancy as predisposing factor among the malignancies genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence 45% hypertension 25% was the most common co morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus 19% in this patient population in addition obesity 11% was common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe our findings support an asian korean study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 48% patients with vte co morbid neurological disease other than stroke and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt 10% and pe 11% respectively both these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time predisposing them to vte venography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively in our study venography was used in just 4% patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one third of the patients perhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors overall most 93% patients were managed as inpatients 39% diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and 54% admitted to hospital with diagnosis of vte mean duration of hospitalization of 79 days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data in selected low risk patients outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered this approach was observed in small proportion 7% of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis nearly all 97% of whom had only dvt the reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study 15% was half of that 30% reported in vellore registry this could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites most 40% 32/81 dvt cases were diagnosed between and postoperative weeks but pe in most cases 70% 7/10 was diagnosed during the first postoperative week we notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less 6% 7/124 frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against 18% 64/352 and 14% 10/73 of acute dvt alone and pe alone respectively the use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines which recommend at least days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation lmwh fondaparinux intravenous ufh or subcutaneous ufh and at least months of long term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin antagonist bleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient age advances in this registry anticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% of the study population the prospective reite registry has reported rate of 3% for major fatal bleeds thus the fear of bleeding complications which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment appears to be minimal dvt complicated by pe 60% and pe alone 75% were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone 25% similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was 5% for primary and 14% for secondary diagnosis we report hospital readmission rate of 6% however we do not know the cause for readmission the death rate was 7% among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against rate of 1% among those who were hospitalized with diagnosis of vte over 90% of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment in our study the hospital discharge rate 97% was more than triple and death rate was quarter of that reported by pandey et al hospital discharge rate 31% and death rate 16% at university hospital in delhi our data show significant increase in acute dvt pe from 2006 to 2010 this can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted although there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from 2006 to 2010 the burden of pe is almost double 13% of all vte of 7% rate reported at christian medical college vellore during 10-year period from 1996 to 2005 our finding is consistent with study from north india that reported 16% incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies this study has the expected limitations of any retrospective review including the availability of complete records for all patients although robust review of the data on medical charts was conducted controlling for bias and confounders is difficult as there is no randomization and no blinding follow up data of patients after hospital discharge were not available in cases of death further the clinic charts reviewed in this study included mix of those from vascular surgery and hematology departments limiting the generalizability of the study results despite these limitations this study provides large amount of useful information in short span of time on patient characteristics clinical outcomes management strategies and temporal trends in vte based on real world data that reflect actual day to day clinical practice over period of years across three sites in india we believe that this information will serve as guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india real world data reflecting actual day to day clinical practice in vte over period of years across three sites in india showed that vte is not uncommon in indian patients and that acute dvt was responsible for the substantial burden of vte we believe that this information will serve as guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india liesel

            "Article: <start> there is an epidemic of stroke in low and middle income countries due to rapidly increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors such as hypertension diabetes mellitus dyslipidaemia the need has thus arisen to conduct studies aimed at epidemiologic genetic and phenotypic characterisation of stroke in sub saharan africa to provide evidence based information to confront this menace to this end it is important that controls selected for comparison with cases are recruited with high degree of certainty that they indeed do not have stroke or tia to allow for valid comparisons to be made in view of this simple quick and accurate assessment of symptoms of stroke is needed for epidemiologic studies particularly those of the case control type in 2000 meschia et al developed the questionnaire for verifying stroke free status qvsfs as method for verifying the stroke free phenotype in participants of clinical epidemiological and genetic studies having one or more affirmative answers to any of the questionnaire was associated with finding stroke tia or either stroke or tia on medical record review jones et al showed by directly interviewing participants and review of medical records that the qvsfs had nppv and ppv of 0.96 and 0.71 respectively making the 8-item qvsfs sensitive and valid tool and structured telephone interview format of questionnaire administration still had an excellent sensitivity of 1.0 specificity of 0.86 positive predictive value of 0.36 and negative predictive value of 1.0 among participants aged 60 years and above the qvsfs is also reliable with intra rater and inter rater agreement of stroke free status classification of 0.90 and 0.94 respectively the qvsfs is easy to administer as self report pencil and paper questionnaire or by an interview in person or by telephone and has been translated into spanish by castillo et al for use among hispanic populations two questions in the instrument assess previous diagnosis of either stroke tia together with six questions about stroke symptoms thus not only is the 8-item qvsfs useful tool in identifying stroke free individuals but it could be used to screen for undiagnosed stroke the sensitivity and specificity of having any of the six symptom questions for stroke detection was 0.82 and 0.62 respectively indeed the qvsfs has been successfully used in the recruitment of controls involved genetic studies into ischaemic stroke to screen for cerebrovascular end points in the carotid revascularisation endarterectomy versus stent trial crest and in the reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke regards study this instrument could have tremendous potential in developing countries where stroke prevalence is increasing awareness of stroke symptoms low and the confirmation of stroke diagnosis either missed by health workers or constrained by the pervasive lack of neuro imaging modalities in these low literacy settings the lack of knowledge of stroke symptoms might impact negatively on the performance of stroke symptom questionnaires furthermore there is lack of specific medical terminology for symptoms of stroke in local dialects across sub saharan africa the performance of the questionnaire could be enhanced further by the introduction of culturally acceptable pictures of stroke symptoms one of the key comments regarding the 8-item qvsfs questionnaire is that the benchmark for verification of strokes has relied on review of medical records of patients but this approach may be problematic in settings where medical records are kept under less than optimal circumstances and where patients may not always seek health services for ailments from medical facilities but from herbalists chemical shops and so forth an approach to overcome this limitation would be to examine participants by neurologists or to use cranial ct scan for verification in subset of participants this study seeks to validate the

participants of clinical epidemiological and genetic studies however the performance of this tool in settings where levels of education and awareness of stroke symptoms are low such as sub saharan africa has not been conducted the tool has tremendous potential for widespread use in regions such as ours where stroke incidence prevalence and mortality are escalating and questions on the epidemiology and genetic underpinnings of the stroke epidemic remain unresolved we propose to validate qvsfs for ascertainment of stroke free status of control subjects enrolled in an ongoing stroke epidemiological study in west africa funded by the national institute of health for h3africa the novel aspects of our validation study are firstly to carry out this validation study simultaneously at five tertiary hospitals across nigeria and ghana involving participants speaking three different languages yoruba hausa and akan the qvsfs will be translated into these languages and administered to participants enrolled from neurology and general clinics in these hospitals secondly given the low levels of education the lack of awareness of stroke symptoms and general paucity of semantically equivalent medical terminology in the local dialects for stroke symptoms in our settings we will evaluate the performance of the tool with and without pictograms finally ascertainment of stroke status will be conducted by neurologists across the sites using combination of structured medical history neurological examination review of medical records and neuro imaging gold standard compared with previously published studies which relied on medical records review and neurological examination the 8-item qvsfs is simple accurate and cheap tool which could have widespread use for ascertaining

            "Article: <start> cardiovascular diseases account for the highest mortality rate worldwide and are expected to be the major cause of death by 2020 studies in iran showed that cardiovascular diseases are the most important cause of death and accounted for 42% of all deaths in 2002 timely diagnosis and proactive measures play significant role in effective treatment prevention development of heart damages and the faster recovery of cardiovascular diseases the time it takes to reach hospital or coronary care unit ccu and the time spent for diagnostic and treatment measures are factors influencing the delay or loss of time from the outset of severe cardiac infarction to the beginning of treatment overall the mortality rate of severe cardiovascular deaths is 30% more than half of which occurs before hospitalization however with the advancement of the epidemic this social trend reverses and people at lower socio economic classes become more vulnerable studies conducted in some developing countries showed that the underprivileged are more susceptible to cardiac arrests compared to affluent people furthermore limited accessibility to health services and the inequality in availability of the services furnished by health and treatment systems deprives these people of acceptable and effective treatment limited and unequal accessibility to health services in iran are one of the controversial issues mentioned in several studies in general one of the most important goals of health system is to provide public accessibility and equality in receiving health and treatment services as one measure of development accessibility to health is one of the basic rights of individuals in the society one of the main points in meting out fairness in the health system is that the distribution of health services must not be based on the socio economic status and incomes of individuals inequality in health services in different countries has taken the form of global challenge affected by various factors including individual social economic and geographical variables these factors are stronger in developing countries 10 so that distribution of health services resources in developing countries has turned into fundamental issue therefore the measurement of fair distribution of health services on top of previous measures has been emphasized by world health organization who 11 inequality in distribution of health services is measured by different scales one of the most common is the gini coefficient which is based on the lorenz curve 12 although multiple measures of inequality have been shown to be highly correlated with each other 12 the results of several studies are encouraging and confirming the utility of the gini index in quantifying inequalities in health related subjects thus the gini index and lorenz curve are commonly used in analyzing the inequality in distribution of health care resources 13 16 since accessibility to intensive healthcare in particular for cardiovascular conditions is of utmost importance and since the appropriate distribution of coronary care unit ccu beds and cardiologists can be taken as measure the present study aims to examine the inequality of the geographical distribution of ccu beds and cardiologists in iran using the gini coefficient and the lorenz curve this study conducted useing demographic data from national census in 2012 collected by the statistics center of iran sci the number of ccu beds and cardiologists in public sector by province in 2012 was obtained from iran ministry of health and medical education in the present study among various possible inequality measures such as gini coefficient decile ratio robin hood index and atkinson index preference was given to the gini coefficient because it has at least three major advantages 17 first it is less sensitive to the number of regions and the size of the numerical values in the data material in general third gini coefficient can be presented visually by means of lorenz curve which provides an effective visualization of the inequalities the lorenz curve compares the distribution of given variable with the normal distribution of same variable that represents equality the grater gap between the lorenz curve and diagonal line means the higher inequality in this curve the axis represents the cumulative percentage of population and the axis shows the percentage of the variable which is expressed as the proportion of the cumulative population the 45-degree line is called the equality line because of showing the completely equal distribution in our study the axis represents the cumulative percentage of population of iranian provinces and the axis shows the cumulative frequency of cardiologists and ccu beds in the iranian provinces the gini coefficient is defined as the division of the area between diagonal line and the lorenz curve 14 mathematically speaking g1=1k=1n xkxk1 yk+yk1 where represents the cumulative percentage of the population and represents the cumulative percentage of ccu beds and cardiologists the gini coefficient ranges between and in which theoretically represents complete equality and shows complete inequality of the distribution of given variable in practice however coefficient below 0.2 is considered complete equality one ranging between 0.2 and 0.3 shows high equality one ranging between 0.3 and 0.4 indicates inequality coefficient varying between 0.4 and 0.6 indicates high inequality and coefficient larger than 0.6 represents complete inequality 14 in this study it is assumed that more cardiologist and ccu beds are associated with more access to cardiovascular health services so that people in provinces with higher per capital level of cardiologist and ccu beds have more access to cardiovascular health resources services finally in order to calculate gini coefficient the demographic data and also the number of ccu beds and cardiologists by province were entered and analyzed through ms excel software in 2012 iran had total population of 75 149 669 with total number of 3665 ccu beds and the total number of 953 cardiologists in public sector the province of tehran had the largest percentage of ccu beds 23.7% and cardiologists 17% there were respectively 4.8 and 1.3 ccu beds and cardiologists across the nation per 100 000 individuals table shows the number of cardiologists and ccu beds per 100 000 individuals and the number of cardiologists per 10 ccu beds by province in 2012 the lorenz curves for the ccu beds and cardiologists are illustrated in figures and2 the gini coefficients obtained for ccu beds and cardiologists were 0.129 and 0.045 respectively the findings showed that the national mean number of ccu beds for population of 100 000 is 4.88 which 23 out of total of 31 provinces are below the national mean however the obtained gini coefficients prove statically adequate equality for the geographical distribution of ccu beds across iran previous study showed that the province of yazd enjoys the most equal distribution of ccu beds on one hand and the province of ilam suffers from the least equal distribution of ccu beds 16 study on distribution of active hospital bed in iran reported the gini coefficient for active bed 0.08 and active beds for population of 10 000 people in 2006 9.2 while the province of yazd had maximum and the province of lorestan the minimum beds per population 18 another study conducted in 2002 using morris imbalance coefficient showed the province of yazd stands at the highest rank in terms of the number of hospital beds and the province of semnan ranks the highest in terms of the number of health centers 19 study conducted in the netherlands on the distribution of ccu beds in 24 university hospitals for the period 2004 2006 reported gini coefficients of 0.638 0.569 and 0.569 which reflected unequal distribution 20 study conducted at 2006 reflects equal distribution of non cardiac intensive care beds in iran the numbers of icu post icu and nicu beds per 100 000 individuals in iran reported 5.3 0.4 and 1.6 respectively and the gini coefficient for icu post icu and nicu beds 0.17 0.15 and 0.23 14 another study conducted at 2011 showed high degree of inequality in the distribution of kidney transplant beds in iran the province of tehran had more than half of the beds installed in its hospitals while 17 provinces had no kidney transplant beds at all in south africa there were 168 icu beds counted in 2005 of which 86% were installed in three provinces the proportion of bed varied greatly in different provinces of this country from 1:20 000 to 1:80 000 21 the distribution of secondary and tertiary health services in the palestine is also reported to be unequal mostly concentrated in the downtown in the gaza strip and in the eastern strip the proportions of iu beds per 000 were 1.4 and 1.2 respectively 22 in another study in the u.s.a the trend of gini coefficient during 1970 1997 was used to measure the distribution of hospital beds the northern states have been reported to enjoy an equal distribution of hospital beds 15 lorenz curve of ccu beds in 2012 lorenz curve of cardiologists in 2012 the present study findings showed that the mean number of cardiologists per 100 000 individuals is 1.27 also the mean number of cardiologists per 10 ccu is 2.6 which 13 provinces are below the national mean out of total of 31 provinces the obtained gini coefficient 0.045 proves statically adequate equality in the geographical distribution of cardiologists across iran study conducted on the distribution of specialist physicians in iran at 2010 showed that the numbers of total specialists per 10 000 individuals and per 10 active beds in the country were 1.7 and 1.9 respectively and the gini coefficient of distribution of total specialists reported 0.052 18 the gini coefficient was used in study at 2000 to measure the resource distribution in mental health services in the us showing the gini coefficient for psychologists as 0.13 15 in another study in japan gini coefficient was used to measure equality in geographical distribution of orthopedic services findings showed the orthopedist per 100 000 individuals was 4.3 and the gini coefficient reported 0.36 23 the low gini coefficients obtained in this study suggest that the health system in iran has been relatively successful in establishing fair geographical distribution of coronary care services which can be attributed to the implementation of the fair national health services distribution strategic plan iran is the first east mediterranean country to implement this strategic health plan as its fourth development plan and through iran 20-year vision plan in the health services department 24 furthermore in 1992 comprehensive program the health services classification system was developed in order to avoid unnecessary parallel activities create fairness in the distribution of inpatient health services make accessible the health services to all people across the country reduce the number of unused beds and develop health services classification system on the basis of different specialties and their respective stations by province variables such as patient admission population mean hospital stay length national divisions available facilities and the geographical situation in terms of route and accessibility were determining factors in locating health centers 24 25 for instance the maximum accessibility time to ccu bed is set at 30 minutes therefore if the temporal distance of province to the next level of numerical reference shows time length longer than 30 minutes the calculated beds which may even be below the installation basis would belong to that province and would not be transferred 26 reports show that in the 2006 2007 687 ccu beds were installed in iran indicating the iranian health system approach to promote health and create the conditions for the fair accessibility of health systems to all citizens 27 our study descriptive statistics showed skewed distribution of ccu beds in iran so that the capital tehran accommodating one sixth of the total population of iran owns one fourth of total ccu beds in iran in similar study by ameryoun et al on the non cardiac intensive care beds in tehran the ratios of all non cardiac intensive care beds were almost two times higher than other provinces 14 also in another study by tofighi et al on the distribution of specialists tehran owns 23% of all specialists across the country 18 however study conducted in 2002 19 showed that by morris measure the health centers in tehran do not constitute balanced distribution burdened with problems such as traffic jams and other problems rampant in metropolitan cities causing delays and waste of time from the beginning of acute myocardial infarction symptoms to the initiation of treatment accessibility to the ccu bed furthermore problems such as overcrowded hospitals in tehran drop in quality and quantity of health services inadequacy of services on one hand and waste of funds for the provinces and finally drop in public health on the other hand are other problems plaguing megacities therefore health policy makers should emphasize decentralization in tehran and identify extra health facilities in different cities so that balanced allocation of resources may be achieved fair geographical distribution of health services would lead to efficient and cost effective health system while existing classificatory models in iran focus on structural development the number of beds and model of providing health services few studies have concentrated on the distribution by area classification and defining areas on the basis of optimal distribution of health services 26 therefore current study may provide foundation for large scale planning for the health systems in order to remove the inequality in the distribution of health services further research and surveys are strongly recommended to acquire more information and monitor the fairness of distribution of different health systems nationally and across provinces the aforementioned results represent an initial empirical approximation the validity of which is limited for the following reasons first counting the number of cardiologists and ccu beds is not an appropriate way to measure extant cardiovascular care and access to it more sufficient reliable measure in iran is not available yet second the methodology used to measure inequality is not perfect and biased with limitations in measuring inequality for example utilizing the gini coefficient showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran though primary information on the distribution of beds and cardiologists showed that about one fourth of the ccu beds are existed in tehran where one sixth of the total population of iran is living such interpretations are helpful for providing an approximation of existing distributions and can show some limitations of using inequality measures despite the fact that the present study is one of the few studies conducted on the geographical distribution of one health services cardiovascular health services in iran selecting only two factors the number of beds and physicians in the distribution of facilities and administering only one measure the gini coefficient may be considered as the limitations of this study also because of the unavailability of private sector and province specific data the research did not consider the private sector capacity and could not produce detailed provincial results which are hoped to be overcome in future studies measuring equality in distribution of private sector resources or all the private and public resources together could have extremely different results using gini measure showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran nevertheless our descriptive statistics showed that there is skewness in distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran moreover even the equal distribution of cardiovascular health facilities such as ccu beds does not mean they are sufficiently provided in iran. <end>\n",

tuberculosis beijing and east african indian eai genotype strains strains each originating from vietnam statistical analysis was performed by using an unpaired mann whitney test for beijing genotype strains the increase in mutation frequency during exposure to rif could be due to described missense mutations in the mut genes 13 such mutations in the mut genes can change the dna repair mechanism as consequence the frequency of resistant mutant formation might increase however direct correlation between the occurrence of particular mutations in mut genes and altered mutation frequency has not been proven furthermore werngren and hoffner 14 found an equal mutation frequency for beijing 3.6 10 and non beijing 4.4 10 genotypes possible explanation for the discrepancy in findings might be the concentration of rif used in the subculture plates in our study the critical concentration of mg rif was used 11 whereas werngren and hoffner used concentration of mg rif in addition werngren and hoffner compared the beijing and non beijing genotypes of several genotype families whereas we compared beijing and eai genotype strains that were selected from the same tuberculosis endemic area and

            "Article: <start> the need for magnetic resonance imaging mri in patients with an implanted pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd is growing clinical issue it is estimated that as many as 75% of active cardiac device recipients will become indicated for mri currently the vast majority of such devices are contraindicated for use with an mri in european heart rhythm association survey published recently for non mri certified icds 0.51.5 field strength the totally subcutaneous icd icd system an implantable defibrillator with no leads that touch the heart has recently been demonstrated to be safe and effective defibrillator option for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death it provides shock therapy and post shock pacing therapy but no long term bradycardia pacing although it has been shown as an alternative to the standard transvenous icd its compatibility with mri remains unclear various types of clinical mri systems currently use superconductive magnet that creates static magnetic field strength typically 1.5 or the use of mri with most pacemakers and icds is considered contraindication due to potential hazards including heating of the electrode that resides in or on the heart damage to myocardium elevation of pacing thresholds unintended induction of ventricular tachycardia vt or ventricular fibrillation vf pacing inhibition permanent device malfunction and distortion of the mri scan recently mr conditional mr conditional indicates lack of known hazards in specified mri environment with specified conditions of use due to the variety of mri scanners and scanning protocols it is not practical to test even single device under all conditions hence mr conditional labelling dictates that the device is safe for use under certain scanning conditions as well as how the cardiac device should be programmed before an exposure to the magnetic field in mri scanner the literature although limited provides some guidance for imaging patients with implanted pacemakers or icds that do not have mr conditional labelling this single centre prospective non controlled study describes the first use of mri in patients

patients reported no sensation or pain from heating of the can two of 15 patients reported feeling some heating and two patients reported intolerable heating see table in patients with intolerable heating the scan was halted within seconds and changed to scan of the brain which proceeded without incident patient reports of heating in the vicinity of the can occurred only during lumbar scans with thermistor probe no such reports occurred during scans of the brain cardiac area cervical spine or without the probe in two cases where heating in the vicinity of the can was reported by the patient the scan sequence was altered to reduce the intensity of radiofrequency rf field exposure by reducing the turbo factor e.g from 21 to increasing the repetition time e.g to 4000 ms and reducing the flip angle e.g from 170 to 120 the target values were chosen arbitrarily to maintain image contrast flip angle and keep scan time at reasonable limits turbo factor and repetition time less heating was noted by patients after these modifications to the scan parameters were made 03 was observed to have skin lesion appearing to be circular rash or ulcer on the surface of the skin over the can approximately 35 mm in diameter the cause of this skin anomaly is not known it was later noted to have fully healed at follow up 10 days after the scan to ascertain the effect of heating due to the instrumented thermistor catheter the two patients who experienced the heating examinations and 16 see table were rescanned several weeks later without the thermistor catheter in place examinations 11 and 17 first modified sequence with even lower amount of energy deposited in the tissue was used which caused no heating as no sensation was reported by the subjects they were asked to report even minimal discomfort and the lumbar scans were performed using the same settings that resulted in heating with the thermistor catheter in place in the first imaging session the results of the rescans revealed that no heating was felt by the patients when the thermistor catheter was absent there were no noted changes to battery voltage ability to detect the qrs signal or stored diagnostic data pacing thresholds can not be assessed by the icd system so this was not evaluated none of the patients reported any pulling or twisting of the can or pain from heating of the icd electrode for scans of the brain lumbar spine knee and cervical spine no effect from image artefact was noted in the anatomical area of interest however for scans of the cardiac area image artefact was noted to interfere

limited reports about mr conditional icds biotronik announced in late 2011 release of their first mr compatible icd device and defibrillator leads pro mri but in the conditions of use excluded scanning of the torso and focused more on the extremities examination in european heart rhythm association survey 60% of centres did not implant any mri certified icds 34.3% implanted 10 icd devices and only 5.6% implanted 10 and more icds one fifth of responders stated that mri certified icds should be implanted in all patients but lack of reimbursement was indicated as possible obstacle to implant more mri certified pacemakers icds by 47.1% of responding centres none of the components of the icd system are on or in the heart the icd depends less upon being in direct contact with the myocardium to function and instead uses far field sensing and stimulation to provide the shock and post shock pacing therapy as consequence unlike transvenous systems heating near or around the electrode can not harm the myocardium which could present with possible safety consequences such as an elevation in pacing thresholds or scarring of the myocardium but it may still cause serious patient discomfort because the icd is larger than modern transvenous icd there may be more potential for the can to experience heating due to the magnetic gradient or rf field we report results from what we believe is the first experience of mri scanning in patients with an implanted icd and in various anatomical areas overall mri was performed safely in all patients which is in contrast to the current literature with mri imaging in patients with electrical active devices which are not mri conditional in our study the primary clinically significant event attributable to the mri scan was the occurrence of heating in the area of the pocket in the four patients that underwent lumbar scans it was not known if this was due to the icd can itself or an artefact of the thermistor catheter used to measure skin temperature over the pocket this required revision of our protocol which was to re scan two of the patients who complained of heating re scanning of these patients without the thermistor probe resulted in no complaints of heating so it is assumed that the thermistor catheter itself heated during the lumbar scans and caused the discomfort as further evidence all the heating complaints occurred during rf intensive scan sequences namely fast spin echo with the temperature probe located axially near the centre of the bore where rf fields are the highest the thermistor catheter is constructed of insulated conductive cables connected to electrodes and should couple to the rf fields efficiently causing heating at the electrodes and pain or damage on the surface of the skin where the probe was placed over the icd can if the heating was due to the icd can itself it would more likely occur during gradient intensive scan sequences which can generate eddy currents on can surfaces and internal components and at locations in the bore where there are high gradient fields such as near the bore edges however when the patient was scanned with gradient intensive scan sequences e.g flair dwi and with the icd system in high gradient field locations in the bore e.g such as during brain scan patients did not detect any heating or discomfort in addition the subcutaneous lead which was not instrumented with thermistor catheter never resulted in any heating sensation noted by the patient even when exactly the same sequence that resulted in heating in the first session was used the use of mri compatible temperature monitors such as fibre optic temperature probes would have provided better confirmation of possible skin temperature elevation and would not have been affected by the rf fields for cardiac imaging the main problem to solve is metallic artefact especially on the gradient echo sequences like in research performed by nazarian et al several scan protocols were used to see if any yielded different effects or reduced the qualitative extent of artefact gradient mode was changed from normal to whisper resulting in slower ramping of the field and therefore diminishing the changes of the magnetic field in time artefacts when present were limited to blurring of the left ventricle during cardiac scans and most yielded clinically useful information standard interrogation of the icd revealed no adverse effects upon the functioning of the system while no adverse effects upon the post scan icd device function were noted not all possible scanning protocols were tested it should be noted that four of the icd were exposed to repeat mri scans without adverse effects to device function in addition because the icd does not provide long term bradycardia pacing it is assumed that pacemaker dependent patients would not be implanted with this system the inhibition of the pacemaker function during the scanning sequence and possible pacing threshold changes are unique concern in patients implanted with transvenous icds this study included only 15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5 mri scanner thus even these preliminary results should only be applied to 1.5 mri scanners similarly as reported in the present literature for other implantable devices device functionality was tested immediately after the scan but not for long term effects in addition not all device functions were tested although the icd system does have beeper interrogation warning if battery levels or memory irregularities occur however patients were scheduled for regular check up and no defect of the device was observed in following 725 months mean observation time 18 months delayed enhancement mri for determining cardiac scarring was also not tested also there are other anatomical areas that were not evaluated such as shoulder and knees this study included only 15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5 mri scanner thus even these

was also not tested also there are other anatomical areas that were not evaluated such as shoulder and knees while more data are required to support claim of mri conditional this study is the study to demonstrate the feasibility of exposing icd patients to mri using the scanning and monitor protocol described with some precautionary measures including programming the device therapy off ii limiting the sar to 2.0 kg iii continuous monitoring of the patients pulse oximetry and ecg by qualified personnel and especially for any feelings of heating iv evaluate device function post scan availability of full resuscitation facilities at the mri site given the variables of different mri scanners the decision to perform mri on patients with an implanted icd system should be balanced against the potential risks in our study the only heating was very likely introduced by not fully mri compatible thermometer probe subjects rescanned without the probe did not report any abnormalities during the scan of any body area listed brain cervical and lumbar spine heart and knee this study was supported by iga mz nt12094/2011 research project charles university in prague prvouk p34 and unce
